Basic: How to start
----------------------------------------
 Prerequisites

   - JRE 6 or later, available from Oracle.

1. Step into the osgi dir

2. Start the OSGi framework by:
   > java -jar framework.jar

3. This starts the framework + a predefined set of bundles, including
   the Knopflerfish desktop bundle

4. Restart can be done in two ways:

   Restart from the previous state
   > java -jar framework.jar

   Make a clean start
   > java -jar framework.jar -init


Building:
----------------------------------------

Please note: building, or rebuilding, a downloaded Knopflerfish SDK
will overwrite the pre-compiled bundles shipped with the Knopflerfish
SDK.

 Prerequisites

   - JDK 6 or later, available from Open JDK, Oracle or elsewhere.
   - Ant 1.9.1 or later, available from ant.apache.org.
   - openssl, to create and manipulate certificates when using
     security and the Conditional Permission Admin (CPA) service. Test
     suites for CPA can not be built and executed without openssl.
   - ProGuard 4.10 or later, tested with 5.2. This is only need if you want
     to build the compact version of the framework. You need ProGuard 5
     or later if you want to build with Java 8.

1. Step into the osgi dir
2. Start the build by:
   > ant all
