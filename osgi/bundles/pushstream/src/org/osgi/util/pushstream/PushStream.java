/**
 * A Push Stream fulfills the same role as the Java 8 stream but it reverses the
 * control direction. The Java 8 stream is pull based and this is push based. A
 * Push Stream makes it possible to build a pipeline of transformations using a
 * builder kind of model. Just like streams, it provides a number of terminating
 * methods that will actually open the channel and perform the processing until
 * the channel is closed (The source sends a Close event). The results of the
 * processing will be send to a Promise, just like any error events. A stream
 * can be used multiple times. The Push Stream represents a pipeline. Upstream
 * is in the direction of the source, downstream is in the direction of the
 * terminating method. Events are sent downstream asynchronously with no
 * guarantee for ordering or concurrency. Methods are available to provide
 * serialization of the events and splitting in background threads.
