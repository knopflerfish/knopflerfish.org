5 The console can be accessed remotely using telnet
The <i>consoletelnet</i> bundle, which is installed by default allows
remote acces to a framework using any telnet client.

6 Bundle packages need to be refreshed after update
To make sure all exported classes are refreshed after a bundle update,
you should <i>refresh</i> the packages. The Desktop bundle menu or console
both have refresh commands.

<p>
Menu:
<p>
 Bundle - Refresh bundle packages
</p>
</p>

<p>
Console:
<p>
 &gt; /framework refresh
</p>
</p>

7 The Knopflerfish Desktop can be run on other OSGi frameworks.
Just install and start the Desktop and util bundle jars on the target
framework.

<p>----</p>
8 Bundles can have custom icons in the Desktop view
A bundle developer can specify a custom icon resource using 
the <i>Application-Icon</i> manifest attribute. Icon can use
any image format as AWT/Swing can read, as JPEG, PNG or GIF.
<p>
This is how the desktop bundle sets its own icon in the "Large Icon"
display.
</p>
<p>
If no icon is specified, <img src="bundle.png"> is used for bundles with
an activator, <img src="lib.png"> is used for bundles without an activator.
</p>

<p>----</p>
9 New Desktop views can be installed
A developer can write a bundle exporting a Desktop plugin service.
See <i>org.knopflerfish.service.desktop</i> javadoc for more info.

13 Mailing list for discussing Knopflerfish usage and development are available
There is also a low traffic announcements list where all new releases
are announced.

14 Knopflerfish doesn't really mean anything
But it's hard to spell and sounds nice

<p>----</p>
15 The System.out and System.err streams is logged in the OSGi log
The System.out stream is logged on the system bundle as INFO events.
The System.err stream is logged as ERROR events.

<p>----</p>
16 The commons-logging bundle provides the Apache Commons Logging API

If you install the commons-logging bundle a bundle (or lib) can use
the Apache commons logging API with all logs sent to the OSGi log. The
log entries are found on the log bundle.
<p>
See <a href="https://www.knopflerfish.org/svn/knopflerfish.org/trunk/osgi/bundles_opt/commons-logging/readme.txt">https://www.knopflerfish.org/svn/knopflerfish.org/trunk/osgi/bundles_opt/commons-logging/readme.txt</a>

17 The entire Knopflerfish source is available in a Subversion repository

Knopflerfish uses Subversion as version control system for all its
files. The repository can be browsed at
<p>
 <a href="https://www.knopflerfish.org/svn">https://www.knopflerfish.org/svn</a></p>

<p>
For example, this entire tip file is available at

18 This Desktop is just another OSGi bundle
The Desktop bundle is a normal bundle, using Swing to display it's interface.
<p>
As long as the JVM supports swing, nothing prevents you from writing your own 
swing bundles. Do close your windows yourself, though ;)
</p>
<p>
And don't forget that all operations on Swing components that changes
their state must be performed on the EDT (Event Dispatch Thread). This
includes the creation / initialization of the GUI components.
</p>
<p>
Also remember that all packages starting with "javax." must be
imported in the manifest of an OSGi bundle.
</p>

<p>----</p>
19 This dialog doesn't block the main window

You can have the tip dialog open at the same time you work with
the main Desktop window.

<p>----</p>
20 All system and framework properties can be viewed from the Desktop

Open the "Framework info" dialog using the Desktop Help menu.
<p>
 Help - Framework info
</p>

<p>----</p>
21 All console commands have automatic shortcuts

Each console command can be shortened to the shortest unique
string.
<p>
For example "/framework update 15" can be shortened to
<p>
 &gt; /fr up 15
</p>
</p>

<p>----</p>
22 You can copy the log to the clipboard

The log can be copied to the clipboard, by showing the log detail view
and right-clicking on the log entries. Then select "Copy log to clipboard".
<p>
The log can then be pasted as text into your favorite editor.
</p>

<p>----</p>
23 The platform name is defined using a system property

The system property <i>org.osgi.provisioning.spid</i> is used to define
the platform name. This name is displayed in the Desktop window's title
bar.

<p>----</p>
24 Detail information panes can be shown as separate windows

Each of the Detail information panes can be displayed as a floating,
resizable window by clicking on the small <img src="float.png">  &nbsp;&nbsp;float icon in the upper right corner.
<p>
The window can be restored by closing it, or by clicking on the float icon
again.
</p>

<p>----</p>
25 The Bundle Repository can be used from the Desktop

The Knopflerfish bundlerepository.jar bundle includes a Desktop plugin which allows access to bundles in OBR format.

<p>
OBR is a bundle repository format introduced by the Oscar OSGi project.
The format consists of an XML file describing all available bundles and an OSGi OBR bundle which should be installed on an OSGi framework. When started, 
the OBR bundle can read the XML file, list bundles, and install bundles 
and their dependencies.
