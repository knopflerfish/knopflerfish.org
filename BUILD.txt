To build Knopflerfish from scratch you need:

 Java SE 6.
    To build bundles compatible with JDK 1.6 and later. Bundles built
    this way will run on jdk 1.7 but it will not work to put classes
    using generics from these builds on the classpath when compiling
    other Java code using the 1.7 javac.


 Java SE 7 (or later)
    To build bundles for Java SE 6 and later. Bundles built with 
    javac from Java 7 requires a Java 6 JRE to run.


 Ant 1.9.3 (or later)


 [OPTIONAL] Proguard 5.2 (or later)
    Proguard is only used when building the compact version of
    framework.
    
Type "ant all" in this directory to build all bundles and test bundles.
