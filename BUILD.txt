To build Knopflerfish from scratch you need:

 JDK 8
    To build bundles compatible with JDK 1.8 and later.

JDK 11 (or later)
    To build bundles for JDK11 and later. Please note the following limitations:
    - Compact version of framework is not built since the proguard compactor
      does not support Java > 8

 Ant 1.9.7 (or later)


 [OPTIONAL] Proguard 5.2 (or later)
    Proguard is only used when building the compact version of
    framework.
    
Type "ant all" in this directory to build all bundles and test bundles.
