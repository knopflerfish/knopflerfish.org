OSGi R4 v4.3 specification. Please consult the "OSGi Service Platform,
Core Specification, Release 4 Version 4.3" for more information.

Framework 6.0.0

   the new OSGi framework specification and improve stability.

   be restored in the next release.

All the Compendium Specification Services included are updated to

The version of these bundles has been set to 4.0.0 and all imported
packages has a minimum version in their import statements set to the
version of the package defined in the OSGi R4 v4.3 specification.

Http 4.0.0
 - The methods javax.servlet.Request.getLocale() and
   javax.servlet.Reuqest.getLocales() now returns data based on the
   Accept-Language header in the request.
 - Improve error messages when the configured server socket is
   in use.
 - Add description for all properties in the Http-configuration to
   the metadata.xml file describing the configuration.


----------------------------------------------
Knopflerfish Specific
----------------------------------------------

The SOAP related bundles present in Knopflerfish 3 has been
removed since they are deprecated and should be replaced by usage of
the Remote Service Admin service from the compendium specification.
The removed bundles are: axis-osgi, axis2-osgi, ksoap-osgi,
ksoap_commandgroup, ksoap_remotefw, soap_desktop, soap_remotefw,
soapclient and soapobject.

Desktop 4.0.0
 - A new "Wiring" displayer has been added that presents information
   from new wiring API. This displayer replaces the "Package"
   displayer that only showed wiring info for the osgi.wiring.package
   namespace.
 - Use the wiring API to perform refresh and resolve operations.
 - Use the start-level API to perform start-level operations.
 - Improve layout of the tool-bar by add some glue to the left of the
   start level label. In the start-level drop-down, emphasis the
   start-level number and present the bundles on each start level as
   list using a smaller, weaker font.
 - Added additional overlay images in the Bundle Icon view to indicate 
   the following bundle states: RESOLVED, STARTING and STOPPING.

Framework Commands 4.0.0
 - New command 'capability' that presents both provided and required
   capabilities for the current bundle revision of a bundle.
 - New command 'wiring' that lists all active wires for the current
   wiring of a bundle.

LogCommands 4.0.0
 - Calling the comamnd "logconfig memory <int>" did not change the
   memory limit, but calling "logconfig memory -c <int>" did.  Now
   both calls changes the limit on the number of log entries that are
   keept in memory as expected.
