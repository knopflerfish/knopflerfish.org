<h1>Directory deployer</h1>

<p>
Simple bundle which scans file system directories and
installs/uninstalls bundles found or removed from these directories.
</p>

<p>
This is a quite useful tool for handle bundle deployment without using any 
console. Just copy the bundles that should be started to the deploy 
directory, and the directory deployer will find and start them. When the 
files are removed, they are uninstalled.
</p>

<h2>Deploy method</h2>

<p>The procedure for scanning and deploying is as follows:

<ol>
  <li>
      Check if any new files have appeared or if any already deployed
      files has been replaced with newer files.
  </li>

  <li>
      New files are installed into the framework.<br> At the end of
      the scan any bundle that was installed will be started according
      to its activation policy. Any fragment that was installed will
      be attached to its host (be resolving it).
  </li>

  <li>
      Updated bundle files (newer than a previously deployed bundle) are
      not installed again, instead, the installed bundle is updated
      from the new file.
  </li>

  <li>
      Check if there are bundle installed by the directory deployer
      that does not correspond to a file found during the directory
      scan. If such bundles are found uninstall them.
  </li>

  <li>
      If any bundle update was performed during the scan, perform a
      refresh bundles operation for them using the in the framework
      wiring API.
  </li>

  <li>
      Start newly installed bundles that can be started, resolve newly
      installed fragments. Note that there will only be one start /
      resolve attempt made for each bundle after an install or update.
  </li>

  <li>
      Sleep a while
  </li>

  <li>
      Repeat from 1.
  </li>

</ol>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>
See <a href="$(SVN_REPO_URL)/$(SVN_TAG)/osgi/bundles_opt/dirdeployer/resources/OSGI-INF/metatype/metatype.xml">metatype.xml</a>
for specification using CM. The same properties as defined by CM are
also read as default values from framework properties. Thus, the
bundle can be both configured by CM and using system properties.
</p>

<p>You can set the deployment directory in <tt>metatype.xml</tt> in
the bundle's resource directory (defaults to <tt>./load</tt>). A
relative deployment directory path is relative to the directory from
which the framework is started.</p>

The table below describes the framework properties that may be used to
set the default values for the directory deployer configuration.
