/**
 * The StartLevel service allows management agents to manage a start level
 * assigned to each bundle and the active start level of the Framework. There is
 * at most one StartLevel service present in the OSGi environment.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A start level is defined to be a state of execution in which the Framework
 * exists. StartLevel values are defined as unsigned integers with 0 (zero)
 * being the state where the Framework is not launched. Progressively higher
 * integral values represent progressively higher start levels. e.g. 2 is a
 * higher start level than 1.
 * <p>
 * Access to the StartLevel service is protected by corresponding
 * {@code ServicePermission}. In addition {@code AdminPermission}
 * is required to actually modify start level information.
 * <p>
 * Start Level support in the Framework includes the ability to control the
 * beginning start level of the Framework, to modify the active start level of
 * the Framework and to assign a specific start level to a bundle. How the
 * beginning start level of a Framework is specified is implementation
 * dependent. It may be a command line argument when invoking the Framework
 * implementation.
 * <p>
 * When the Framework is first started it must be at start level zero. In this
 * state, no bundles are running. This is the initial state of the Framework
 * before it is launched.
 * 
 * When the Framework is launched, the Framework will enter start level one and
 * all bundles which are assigned to start level one and whose autostart setting
 * indicates the bundle should be started are started as described in the
 * {@code Bundle.start} method. The Framework will continue to increase
 * the start level, starting bundles at each start level, until the Framework
 * has reached a beginning start level. At this point the Framework has
 * completed starting bundles and will then fire a Framework event of type
 * {@code FrameworkEvent.STARTED} to announce it has completed its
 * launch.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Within a start level, bundles may be started in an order defined by the
 * Framework implementation. This may be something like ascending
 * {@code Bundle.getBundleId} order or an order based upon dependencies
 * between bundles. A similar but reversed order may be used when stopping
 * bundles within a start level.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The StartLevel service can be used by management bundles to alter the active
 * start level of the framework.
