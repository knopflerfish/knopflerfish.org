<h2 class="kf">OSGi Release 4 Version 4.3 - What is New?</h2>
<div class="release_notes">
  <p>
    Below is a short summary of the most important new features in OSGi 4.3.
  </p>
  <div class="note_group">
    <div class="note_name"> Generics </div>
    <div class="note_item">
      The core OSGi API uses generics which allows for type-safe use of the framework API.
      I.e. no more casting. Support for Java 1.4 run-time environments
      is maintained via the -target jsr14 compiler flag.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="note_group">
    <div class="note_name"> Capabilities </div>
    <div class="note_item">
      In OSGi 4.3 a bundle can declare generic requirements and
      capabilities through the <code>Require-Capability</code> and
      <code>Provide Capability</code> manifest headers.  These two
      headers are inspected during the resolving phase of the bundle.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="note_group">
    <div class="note_name"> Bundle Wiring API </div>
    <div class="note_item">
      The new Wiring API replaces the PackageAdmin service and also

      have been resolved by the framework.

  </div>
  <div class="note_group">
    <div class="note_name"> Adapt pattern </div>
    <div class="note_item">
      OSGi 4.3 introduces an adapt method on the Bundle class. The new
      method provides specialized access to the Bundle object,
      creating a certain view of the bundle, without adding additional
      methods to the bundle class. The adapt patterns is typically
      used to replace the former StartLevelService by providing a
      BundleStartLevel object with the start level operations
      for a bundle.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="note_group">
    <div class="note_name"> Framework hooks </div>
    <div class="note_item">
      A set of hooks have been added with allows bundles to plug-into the framework
      for close interaction with the framework. The following hooks exist in 4.3:
      <ul>
        <li>Resolver Hooks</li>
        <li>Bundle Hooks</li>
        <li>Service Hooks</li>
