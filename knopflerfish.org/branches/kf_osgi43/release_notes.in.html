  $(BASE_URL)/$(VERSION)
</p>
  <p>
    Knopflerfish 4 is an implementation of the "OSGi Service Platform

<h2 class="kf">OSGi Release 4 Version 4.3 - What is New?</h2>
<div class="release_notes">
  <p>
    Below is a short summary of the most important new features in OSGi 4.3. 
  </p>
  <div class="note_group">
    <div class="note_name"> Generics </div>
    <div class="note_item">
      The core OSGi API uses generics which allows for type-safe use of the framework API. 
      I.e. no more casting. Support for Java 1.4 run-time environments
      is maintained via the -target jsr14 compiler flag. 
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="note_group">
    <div class="note_name"> Capabilities </div>
    <div class="note_item">
      In OSGi 4.3 a bundle can declare generic requirements and capabilities through the 
      <code>Require-Cabability</code> and <code>Provide Capability</code> manifest headers. 
      These two headers are inspected during the resolving phase of the bundle.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="note_group">
    <div class="note_name"> Bundle Wiring API </div>
    <div class="note_item">
      The new Wiring API replaces the PackageAdmin service and also
      provide information how requirements and provided capabilities
      have been resolved by the framework. 
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="note_group">
    <div class="note_name"> Adapt pattern </div>
    <div class="note_item">
      OSGi 4.3 introduces an adapt method on the Bundle class. The new
      method provides specialized access to the Bundle object,
      creating a certain view of the bundle, without adding additional
      methods to the bundle class. The adapt patterns is typically
      used to replace the former StartLevelService by providing a
      BundleStartLevel object with the start level operations
      for a bundle. 
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="note_group">
    <div class="note_name"> Framework hooks </div>
    <div class="note_item">
      A set of hooks have been added with allows bundles to plug-into the framework 
      for close interaction with the framework. The following hooks exist in 4.3: 
      <ul>
	<li>Resolver Hooks</li>
	<li>Bundle Hooks</li>
	<li>Service Hooks</li>
	<li>Weaving Hooks</li>
