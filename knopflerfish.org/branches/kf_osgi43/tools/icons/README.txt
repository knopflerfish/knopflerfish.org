		Icons in Knopflerfish
======================================================================

With KF3 there will be a switchover to the Tango icon set:
http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project

The Tango base icon library has been released to the public domain and
is free to use. The complete unmodified set is checked in under
icon_sets_orig.

Any modifications, or additions made to the original icons are placed
in kf-icon-theme. 

THe kf_icons.ods contains additional information on which icon is used
by which bundle.
