/**
  * This is the interface of the Deployment Admin service.<p>
  * 
  * The OSGi Service Platform provides mechanisms to manage the life cycle of
  * bundles, configuration objects, permission objects, etc. but the overall consistency
  * of the runtime configuration is the responsibility of the management
  * agent. In other words, the management agent decides to install, update,
  * or uninstall bundles, create or delete configuration or permission objects, as
  * well as manage other resource types, etc.<p>
  * 
  * The Deployment Admin service standardizes the access to some of the responsibilities
  * of the management agent. The service provides functionality to manage Deployment Packages 
  * (see {@link DeploymentPackage}). A Deployment Package groups resources as a unit 
  * of management. A Deployment Package is something that can be installed, updated, 
  * and uninstalled as a unit.<p> 
  * 
  * The Deployment Admin functionality is exposed as a standard OSGi service with no 
  * mandatory service parameters.
