Release Notes Knopflerfish @VERSION@
--------------------------------

  Maintenance release of Knopflerfish 1.3 (OSGi R3)

  Here follows a breakdown of the most important changes since the 
  last release.


=== Framework (Core) ===

  Updating a resolved bundle for which a bundle class loader was not
  yet created messed up the book-keeping of packages causing
  unexpected failures to find classes in packages imported by the
  updated bundle. Corrected in framework revision 3.3.9.
  
  Fix an issue with paths in the BundleClassPath manifest attirbute
  that starts with a '/' when using memory storage. Reported in
  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=567241&aid=2198098&group_id=82798
  Corrected in framework version 3.3.10, subversion revision 2560.

  Rearranged synchronized code to avoid dead lock between registerService and
  refreshPackages. Corrected in framework version 3.3.11.

  Rearranged synchronized code to avoid dead lock between Bundles and Package handling.
  Corrected in framework version 3.3.12.

  Changed synchronization code to avoid dead lock in BundleClassLoader.
  Corrected in framework version 3.3.13.

=== Services (Compendium) ===
      
  Meta type

  Removed a number of calls to System.out from the metatype bundles.
  Reported in 
  https://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?func=detail&aid=2406160&group_id=82798&atid=567241
  Subversion revision 2588.


========================================================================


2008-04-25:
             1.3.6 Release

=== Framework (Core) ===

  A number of changes to enable bundles with few permissions to work
  correctly when security is enabled.

  All permission checks are now performed via the active Security
  Manager to enable interception of such checks by a custom Security
  Manager implementation.

  The security policy implementation used by the framework now
  delegates permission derivation to the original policy
  implementation, thus allowing specification of permissions for
  non-bundle packages via the default policy file.


=== Services (Compendium) ===
      
  No changes.


=== Misc (KF specific, start scripts, build system etc ===

  Some build system changes have been back-ported from the
  Knopflerfish 2.0 series. E.g., usage of a local bcel.jar in ant/lib,
  new release note page and a change log based on svn comments, ...


========================================================================


2006-06-26:
             1.3.5 Release

 all:        A few bug fixes

 bundles:    The "Bundle-SymbolicName" header used in bundles
             distributed with releases prior to 1.3.5 does not conform
             to the OSGi-r4 specification. To avoid potential 
             incompatibilities this header has been removed from the
             bundles' manifest files.  

2005-10-14:
             1.3.4 Release

 fw:         Framework starts at level 0. if start level is still 0 
             when launching set level to 1. 
             Remove need for launch flag. If no launch flag is 
             encountered on the command line/xargs file, launch(0) is 
             called.
             Remove archive on purge. Fix for memory leak in bug 
             tracker with request id 1109204.

 prefs:      Fix for bug 1106335 (Preferences doesn't handle dotted 
             keys properly): Make sure that encoded keys do not find 
             their way into the in-memory Preferences objects.
             Fixed bug 1159943 (Preferences.sync() in bundle prefs 
             works not as specified): sync() calls flush().

 desktop:    Fix for bug 1189943 (Desktop bundle throws 
             MalformedURLException). Get resource URL from bundle 
             rather than create it in the desktop bundle.
             Fix for bug 1116067 bug desktop memory leak: By default, 
             the console window is limited to 5000 lines. The limit 
             can be set using the system property 
             org.knopflerfish.desktop.console.maxlines. 0 means infinite.

 log:        The log bundle is no longer dependent on console packages. 
             The log configurations commands which where part of the log
             bundle has been moved to the logcommands bundle.
             Bumped version to 1.0.1.

 logcmd:     Log configurations commands added, moved from the log bundle.
             Bumped version to 1.0.1.

 cm:         The bundle is no longer dependent on any XML packages (sax
             and dom). The package org.knopflerfish.util.cm has been 
             removed from cm. The classes in org.knopflerfish.shared.cm 
             are exported and can be used to read cm-data.
             Bumped version to 1.0.1.

 cmcmd       Uses the org.knopflerfish.shared.cm package from the cm 
             bundle when importing configurations.
             Bumped version to 1.0.1.

 obr:        Source code upgraded to 1.1.2 release from Oscar project.
             Bumped version to 1.1.2.

 consoletty: Uses service tracker for console to avoid startup problems.
             Bumped version to 1.0.1.



2004-12-29: 
             1.3.3 Release


2004-12-21:
 fw:         Fixed FW service listener incorrect behavior
             that could cause same service listeners instance with
             different filters to be called for each filter. This
             only happened when the filter cache had been triggered
             before the listener was added a secondary time.


 device:     Changed device manager listener setup to match above.

             
2004-11-23:

2004-10-29:
 fw:         Fixed BundleClassLoader.getResources() bug that
             didn't returned all available resources when multiple
             identical names existed. Added test (Frame064a) for this.

             Disabled the publicly available bundle: URL syntax.
             This can be enabled/disabled using the
               org.knopflerfish.osgi.registerbundleurlhandler
             system property.

             Made OSGi URL service handler possible to disable
             using system property 
               org.knopflerfish.osgi.registerserviceurlhandler

             Bumped fw version to 3.3.5

             Bundle view areas floatable.

 build:      Bundle-UUID added to bundlebuild_include.xml and
             OBR task. The Bundle-UUID is intended as the missing

2004-07-14

             doesn't result in half-functional registered HttpService.
             
             This means that socket binding failures results in
             no registered HttpService instead of an HttpService
             with no port number property set.

2004-04-13:
             Added start level commands to frameworkcommands bundle

2004-03-22:

2004-03-20:  Added target install, start, stop, update and uninstall
             to bundlebuild_include.xml. These targets communicates
             to a running framework using the telnet console.

             Note: requires netcomponents.jar in $ANT_HOME/lib

2004-03-17:  HTTP bug/oddity fix. 
             HTTP 1.0 and POST and Connection="close" hanged
             the input stream. This is now fixed

             Desktop tested to work on Eclipse OSGi FW!

             > eclipse -console 9191

             > telnet localhost 9191

              osgi > install file:util-1.0.0.jar
              osgi > install file:desktop_all-1.1.0.jar
              osgi > start <desktop bid>

             ...and off you go!

2004-03-17:  Startlevel now truly persistent

             Changed ServiceTracker to comply with ref code
             and catch IllegalStateException in close()

             Changed specification-version on useradmin,
             http and cm to 3-digit.

2004-03-16:  Added grabbing of system out/err to the log service

¨               -Dorg.knopflerfish.log.grabio=true

             System.out.println is logged as INFO on the system bundle.
             System.err.println is logged as ERROR on the system bundle.

             IO grabbing is only active when the log is NOT printing
             directly to stdout to avoid recursive effects. 
     

2004-03-10:  Default http port changed internally to 80.
             Startup xargs still uses 8080
