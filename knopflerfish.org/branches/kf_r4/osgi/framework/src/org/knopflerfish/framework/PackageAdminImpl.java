 * service is valid only until the next time {@link #refreshPackages} is

 * has been updated or removed as a result of calling 
 * PackageAdmin.refreshPackages()),
 * its getName() and getSpecificationVersion() continue to return their
 * old values, isRemovalPending() returns true, and getExportingBundle()

   * Forces the update (replacement) or removal of packages exported by
   * the specified bundles.
   *
   * <p> If no bundles are specified, this method will update or remove any
   * packages exported by any bundles that were previously updated or
   * uninstalled. The technique by which this is accomplished
   * may vary among different framework implementations. One permissible
   * implementation is to stop and restart the Framework.
   *
   * <p> This method returns to the caller immediately and then performs the
   * following steps in its own thread:
   *
   * <ol>
   * <p>
   * <li> Compute a graph of bundles starting with the specified ones. If no
   * bundles are specified, compute a graph of bundles starting with
   * previously updated or uninstalled ones.
   * Any bundle that imports a package that is currently exported
   * by a bundle in the graph is added to the graph. The graph is fully
   * constructed when there is no bundle outside the graph that imports a
   * package from a bundle in the graph. The graph may contain
   * <tt>UNINSTALLED</tt> bundles that are currently still
   * exporting packages.
   *
   * <p>
   * <li> Each bundle in the graph will be stopped as described in the 
   * <tt>Bundle.stop</tt> method.
   *
   * <p>
   * <li> Each bundle in the graph that is in the
   * <tt>RESOLVED</tt> state is moved
   * to the <tt>INSTALLED</tt> state.
   * The effect of this step is that bundles in the graph are no longer
   * <tt>RESOLVED</tt>.
   *
   * <p>
   * <li> Each bundle in the graph that is in the UNINSTALLED state is
   * removed from the graph and is now completely removed from the framework.
   *
   * <p>
   * <li> Each bundle in the graph that was in the
   * <tt>ACTIVE</tt> state prior to Step 2 is started as
   * described in the <tt>Bundle.start</tt> method, causing all
   * bundles required for the restart to be resolved.
   * It is possible that, as a
   * result of the previous steps, packages that were
   * previously exported no longer are. Therefore, some bundles
   * may be unresolvable until another bundle
   * offering a compatible package for export has been installed in the
   * framework.
   * </ol>
   *
   * <p> For any exceptions that are thrown during any of these steps, a
   * <tt>FrameworkEvent</tt> of type <tt>ERROR</tt> is
   * broadcast, containing the exception. 
   *
   * @param bundles the bundles whose exported packages are to be updated or 
   * removed,
   * or <tt>null</tt> for all previously updated or uninstalled bundles.
   *
   * @exception SecurityException if the caller does not have the
   * <tt>AdminPermission</tt> and the Java runtime environment supports
   * permissions.
