/**
 * A synchronous <tt>BundleEvent</tt> listener.
 *
 * <p><tt>SynchronousBundleListener</tt> is a listener interface that may be implemented by a bundle developer.
 * <p>A <tt>SynchronousBundleListener</tt> object is registered with the Framework using the
 * {@link BundleContext#addBundleListener}method.
 * <tt>SynchronousBundleListener</tt> objects are called with a <tt>BundleEvent</tt> object when a bundle has been
 * installed, started, stopped, updated, or uninstalled.
 * <p>Unlike normal <tt>BundleListener</tt> objects, <tt>SynchronousBundleListener</tt>s are
 * synchronously called during bundle life cycle processing. The bundle life cycle
 * processing will not proceed until all <tt>SynchronousBundleListener</tt>s have
 * completed. <tt>SynchronousBundleListener</tt> objects will be called prior to
 * <tt>BundleListener</tt> objects.
 * <p><tt>AdminPermission</tt> is required to add or remove a <tt>SynchronousBundleListener</tt> object.
