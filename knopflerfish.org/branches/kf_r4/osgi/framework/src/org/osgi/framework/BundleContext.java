/**
 * A bundle's execution context within the Framework. The context is used to
 * grant access to other methods so that this bundle can interact with the
 * Framework.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>BundleContext</code> methods allow a bundle to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Subscribe to events published by the Framework.
 * <li>Register service objects with the Framework service registry.
 * <li>Retrieve <code>ServiceReferences</code> from the Framework service
 * registry.
 * <li>Get and release service objects for a referenced service.
 * <li>Install new bundles in the Framework.
 * <li>Get the list of bundles installed in the Framework.
 * <li>Get the {@link Bundle} object for a bundle.
 * <li>Create <code>File</code> objects for files in a persistent storage
 * area provided for the bundle by the Framework.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A <code>BundleContext</code> object will be created and provided to the
 * bundle associated with this context when it is started using the
 * {@link BundleActivator#start} method. The same <code>BundleContext</code>
 * object will be passed to the bundle associated with this context when it is
 * stopped using the {@link BundleActivator#stop} method. A
 * <code>BundleContext</code> object is generally for the private use of its
 * associated bundle and is not meant to be shared with other bundles in the
 * OSGi environment.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <code>Bundle</code> object associated with a <code>BundleContext</code>
 * object is called the <em>context bundle</em>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <code>BundleContext</code> object is only valid during the execution of
 * its context bundle; that is, during the period from when the context bundle
 * is in the <code>STARTING</code>, <code>STOPPING</code>, and
 * <code>ACTIVE</code> bundle states. If the <code>BundleContext</code>
 * object is used subsequently, an <code>IllegalStateException</code> must be
 * thrown. The <code>BundleContext</code> object must never be reused after
 * its context bundle is stopped.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The Framework is the only entity that can create <code>BundleContext</code>
 * objects and they are only valid within the Framework that created them.
