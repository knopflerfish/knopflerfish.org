/**
 * A <code>ServiceEvent</code> listener.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>AllServiceListener</code> is a listener interface that may be
 * implemented by a bundle developer.
 * <p>
 * An <code>AllServiceListener</code> object is registered with the Framework
 * using the <code>BundleContext.addServiceListener</code> method.
 * <code>AllServiceListener</code> objects are called with a
 * <code>ServiceEvent</code> object when a service is registered, modified, or
 * is in the process of unregistering.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>ServiceEvent</code> object delivery to
 * <code>AllServiceListener</code> objects is filtered by the filter specified
 * when the listener was registered. If the Java Runtime Environment supports
 * permissions, then additional filtering is done. <code>ServiceEvent</code>
 * objects are only delivered to the listener if the bundle which defines the
 * listener object's class has the appropriate <code>ServicePermission</code>
 * to get the service using at least one of the named classes the service was
 * registered under.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Unlike normal <code>ServiceListener</code> objects,
 * <code>AllServiceListener</code> objects receive all ServiceEvent objects
 * regardless of the whether the package source of the listening bundle is equal
 * to the package source of the bundle that registered the service. This means
 * that the listener may not be able to cast the service object to any of its
 * corresponding service interfaces if the service object is retrieved.
 * 
 * @version $Revision: 1.7 $
 * @see ServiceEvent
 * @see ServicePermission
 * @since 1.3
