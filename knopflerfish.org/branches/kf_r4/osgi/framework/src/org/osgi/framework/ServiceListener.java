/**
 * A <code>ServiceEvent</code> listener. When a <code>ServiceEvent</code> is
 * fired, it is synchronously delivered to a <code>BundleListener</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>ServiceListener</code> is a listener interface that may be
 * implemented by a bundle developer.
 * <p>
 * A <code>ServiceListener</code> object is registered with the Framework
 * using the <code>BundleContext.addServiceListener</code> method.
 * <code>ServiceListener</code> objects are called with a
 * <code>ServiceEvent</code> object when a service is registered, modified, or
 * is in the process of unregistering.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>ServiceEvent</code> object delivery to <code>ServiceListener</code>
 * objects is filtered by the filter specified when the listener was registered.
 * If the Java Runtime Environment supports permissions, then additional
 * filtering is done. <code>ServiceEvent</code> objects are only delivered to
 * the listener if the bundle which defines the listener object's class has the
 * appropriate <code>ServicePermission</code> to get the service using at
 * least one of the named classes the service was registered under.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>ServiceEvent</code> object delivery to <code>ServiceListener</code>
 * objects is further filtered according to package sources as defined in
 * {@link ServiceReference#isAssignableTo(Bundle, String)}.
