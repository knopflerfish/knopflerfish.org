/**
 * A required bundle.
 * 
 * Objects implementing this interface are created by the Package Admin service.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The term <i>required bundle</i> refers to a resolved bundle that has a
 * bundle symbolic name and is not a fragment. That is, a bundle that may be
 * required by other bundles. This bundle may or may not be currently required
 * by other bundles.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The information about a required bundle provided by this object may change. A
 * <code>RequiredBundle</code> object becomes stale if an exported package of
 * the bundle it references has been updated or removed as a result of calling
 * <code>PackageAdmin.refreshPackages()</code>).
 * 
 * If this object becomes stale, its <code>getSymbolicName()</code> and
 * <code>getVersion()</code> methods continue to return their original values,
 * <code>isRemovalPending()</code> returns true, and <code>getBundle()</code>
 * and <code>getRequiringBundles()</code> return <code>null</code>.
 * 
 * @since 1.2
