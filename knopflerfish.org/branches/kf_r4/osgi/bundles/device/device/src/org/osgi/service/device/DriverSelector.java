 * least one Driver service matches, the device manager must choose one. If
 * there is a Driver Selector service registered with the Framework, the device
 * manager will ask it to make the selection. If there is no Driver Selector
 * service, or if it returns an invalid result, or throws an <code>Exception</code>,
 * the device manager uses the default selection strategy.
