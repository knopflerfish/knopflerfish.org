/**
 * <p>
 * Interface for identifying device services.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A service must implement this interface or use the
 * {@link Constants#DEVICE_CATEGORY}registration property to indicate that it
 * is a device. Any services implementing this interface or registered with the
 * <code>DEVICE_CATEGORY</code> property will be discovered by the device manager.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Device services implementing this interface give the device manager the
 * opportunity to indicate to the device that no drivers were found that could
 * (further) refine it. In this case, the device manager calls the
 * {@link #noDriverFound}method on the <code>Device</code> object.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Specialized device implementations will extend this interface by adding
 * methods appropriate to their device category to it.
 * 
 * @version $Revision: 1.7 $
