/**
 * Listener for Configuration Events. When a <code>ConfigurationEvent</code>
 * is fired, it is asynchronously delivered to a
 * <code>ConfigurationListener</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>ConfigurationListener</code> objects are registered with the
 * Framework service registry and are notified with a
 * <code>ConfigurationEvent</code> object when an event is fired.
 * <p>
 * <code>ConfigurationListener</code> objects can inspect the received
 * <code>ConfigurationEvent</code> object to determine its type, the pid of
 * the <code>Configuration</code> object with which it is associated, and the
 * Configuration Admin service that fired the event.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Security Considerations. Bundles wishing to monitor configuration events will
 * require <code>ServicePermission[ConfigurationListener,REGISTER]</code> to
 * register a <code>ConfigurationListener</code> service.
