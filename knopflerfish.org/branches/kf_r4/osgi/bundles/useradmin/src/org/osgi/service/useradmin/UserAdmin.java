/**
 * This interface is used to manage a database of named <code>Role</code> objects,
 * which can be used for authentication and authorization purposes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This version of the User Admin service defines two types of <code>Role</code>
 * objects: "User" and "Group". Each type of role is represented by an
 * <code>int</code> constant and an interface. The range of positive integers is
 * reserved for new types of roles that may be added in the future. When
 * defining proprietary role types, negative constant values must be used.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Every role has a name and a type.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A {@link User}object can be configured with credentials (e.g., a password)
 * and properties (e.g., a street address, phone number, etc.).
 * <p>
 * A {@link Group}object represents an aggregation of {@link User}and
 * {@link Group}objects. In other words, the members of a <code>Group</code>
 * object are roles themselves.
 * <p>
 * Every User Admin service manages and maintains its own namespace of
 * <code>Role</code> objects, in which each <code>Role</code> object has a unique
 * name.
 * 
 * @version $Revision: 1.10 $
