/**
 * Data Consumer, a service that can receive udpated values from {@link Producer} services.
 *
 * <p>Service objects registered under the <tt>Consumer</tt> interface are expected to consume
 * values from a Producer service via a <tt>Wire</tt> object.
 * A Consumer service may poll the Producer service by calling the {@link Wire#poll} method.
 * The Consumer service will also receive an updated value when called at it's {@link #updated}
 * method.
 * The Producer service should have coerced the value to be an instance of one of the types
 * specified by the {@link Wire#getFlavors} method, or one of their subclasses.
 *
 * <p>Consumer service objects must register with a <tt>service.pid</tt>
 * and a {@link WireConstants#WIREADMIN_CONSUMER_FLAVORS} property.
 * It is recommended that Consumer service objects also register with a
 * <tt>service.description</tt> property.
 *
 * <p>If an <tt>Exception</tt> is thrown by any of the <tt>Consumer</tt> methods,
 * a <tt>WireAdminEvent</tt> of type {@link WireAdminEvent#CONSUMER_EXCEPTION} is
 * broadcast by the Wire Admin service.
 *
 * <p>Security Considerations - Data consuming bundles will require <tt>ServicePermission[REGISTER,Consumer]</tt>.
 * In general, only the Wire Admin service
 * bundle should have this permission. Thus only
 * the Wire Admin service may directly call a Consumer service.
 * Care must be taken in the sharing of <tt>Wire</tt> objects with other bundles.
 * <p>
 * Consumer services must be registered with their scope when they can receive different types of
 * objects from the Producer service. The Consumer service should have <tt>WirePermission</tt> for
 * each of these scope names.
