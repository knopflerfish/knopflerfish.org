<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  The Configuration Management bundle is designed to be a uniform way
  to handle bundle configuration. It contains the 
  <a  target="_top" href="$(JAVADOCLINK)org/osgi/service/cm/ManagedService.html">
    ManagedService
  </a>
  interfaces to be   implemented by bundles that need configuration
  data, and the
  <a  target="_top" href="$(JAVADOCLINK)org/osgi/service/cm/ConfigurationAdmin.html">
    ConfigurationAdmin
  </a>
   service to be used by management bundles that modify configuration data.
<p>
  The ConfigurationAdmin interface is the main interface to the
  Configuration Management component. It is the interface that is
  registered as a service in the Service Registry and it has methods
  for creating, retrieving, and listing configurations. The
  implementation of this interface is responsible for the persistent
  storage of configurations, and listens for registrations of
  ManagedServices and ManagedServiceFactories in the Service Registry
  and passes out configuration data, if available, when they appear.  
</p>
<p>
  The 
  <a href="../cm_cmd/index.html">cm_commands</a>, 
  bundle provides a console command group to Configuration Management.
</p>
<p>
  The 
  <a href="../prefs/index.html">Preference Service</a>, 
  is an alternative method for storing configuration data but it lacks
  the administrative functions the Configuration Management bundle
  provides.
