Simple trayicon supprting start level change and framework shutdown.

In version 3.0 updated to use standard SystemTray and TrayIcon classes
available since Java6 in java.awt package. 

This means that the bundle requires java6 to fully function. Will
compile and start under older java versions, but no tray icon will be
shown.
