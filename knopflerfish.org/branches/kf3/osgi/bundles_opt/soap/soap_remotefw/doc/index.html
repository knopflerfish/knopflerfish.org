<h1>SOAP Remote Framework</h1>

<div class="abstract">
This bundle exports (server) and imports (client) remote OSGI
frameworks, using SOAP. This allows a client bundle, as the Swing
desktop, to remotely control another framework.  </p></div>
</div>

<p>

The bundle is part of the <a href="../soap/index.html#axis1">The
Knopflerfish Axis 1</a> package.

</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>

Implementation of a "remote" OSGi framework, using SOAP. This
implementaiton does currently not support forwarding of log event from
the server framework to the client. For usage instructions see <a
href="../remotefw/index.html">Remote Framework</a>, but replace
references to <tt>ksoap-osgi</tt> with <tt>axis-osgi</tt> and
<tt>ksoap_remotefw</tt> with <tt>soap_remotefw</tt>. Two xargs-file
fragments that can be used when starting a <a
href="server.xargs">server</a> / <a href="client.xargs">client</a>
framework using the Axis&nbsp;1 baser SOAP Remote Framework are
provided by the links in this sentence.

</p>


<h2>Server - Exporting a framework</h2>

<p>

The soap_remotefw bundle can export the entire OSGi framework as a
SOAP service, by registering an instance of
<tt>org.knopflerfish.service.soap.remotefw.RemoteFW</tt>
into the framework, with the property
<tt>SOAP.service.name = OSGiFramework</tt>

</p><p>

This will make the axis-osgi bundle pick up the service and export
all methods. A SOAP client on another host can then access the
server framework.

</p><p>

Typically, this "raw" SOAP service will be available on
<pre>
 http://<it>host</it>:<it>port</it>/axis/service/OSGiFramework
</pre>
and can be viewed directly with the soap_desktop browser.

</p><p>

The default behavior of soap_remotefw is to register a RemoteFW 
instance.

</p>


<h2>Client - Importing a framework</h2>
<p>

The soap_remotefw bundle can also run as a client and import a remote
framework. In that case, a service of class
<pre>
  org.knopflerfish.service.remotefw.RemoteFramework
</pre>
will be registered into the framework. Another bundle can then get this
RemoteFramework service and call its "connect" method. This methods will
return a BundleContext representing the remote framework. See javadocs
for RemoteFramework for details.

</p><p>

The default behavior of soap_remotefw is to register a RemoteFramework 
instance.

</p><p>

The Swing desktop is capable of using the RemoteFramework service. If the
soap_remotefw is active, the desktop will display a connection dialog
allowing the user to connect to a named remote framework.

</p>

<h2>Controlling the soap_remotefw behavior</h2>

The behavior of the soap_remotefw bundle can be controlled
by the following system properties:

<dl>
  <dt><tt>org.knopflerfish.soap.remotefw.server</tt> (default "true")</dt>
  <dd>
      If set to "true", export a SOAP service allowing remote
      management of the entire platform.
      </br>
      If not set to "true", do not export any SOAP service
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>org.knopflerfish.soap.remotefw.client</tt> (default "true")</dt>
  <dd>
      If set to "true", register an implementation of 
      org.knopflerfish.service.remotefw.RemoteFramework
      allowing other bundles to remote manage a framework. This 
      service can be used by the desktop bundle.
      <br/>
      If not set to "true", do not register any RemoteFramework
      service
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>org.knopflerfish.soap.remotefw.client.eventinterval</tt> (default 3000)</dt>
  <dd>
      Interval in milliseconds between event notification. The remote
      bundle context's event notification works by polling the server
      at regular intervals. This property specifies the interval.
  </dd>
</dl>
