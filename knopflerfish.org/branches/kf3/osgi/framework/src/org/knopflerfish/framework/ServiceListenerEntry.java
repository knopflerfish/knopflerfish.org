   * <pre>
   * Simple = '(' attr '=' value ')'
   *        | '(' '|' Simple+ ')'
   * </pre>
   * where <code>attr</code> is one of {@link Constants#OBJECTCLASS},

   * <code>value</code> must not contain a wildcard character.
   * <p>
   * The index of the vector determines which key the cache is for
   * (see {@link ServiceListenerState#hashedKeys}). For each key, there is
   * a vector pointing out the values which are accepted by this
   * ServiceListenerEntry's filter. This cache is maintained to make
   * it easy to remove this service listener.
