  removal of dead code.


----------------------------------------------
Knopflerfish Specific
----------------------------------------------

Console
 - Migration to new OSGi Standard (Done)

Desktop 3.0.9
 - Added support for using options when starting and stopping bundles.
   E.g., a bundle may now be transiently started or stopped.
 - Menu and toolbar entries for starting, stopping, updating and
   uninstalling bundles are now disabled when no bundle is selected.
 - Changing start level for bundles now works when more than one
   bundle is selected.
 - Fixed a problem (dead-lock of the Event Dispatcher Thread) when
   calling the bundle life-cycle operations on the desktop bundle
   itself.
 - Fixed a number of issues when using the desktop with a
   RemoteFramework. E.g., the list of bundles shown was taken from
   the own (client) framework when it should have come from the remote
   (server) framework.


Framework Commands 3.0.1
 - Added support for using options when starting and stopping bundles.
   E.g., a bundle may now be transiently started or stopped.
 - Added the -a (append) option to the cd-command.
 - New command "properties" that may be used to list System and
   Framework properties.

Log 2.0.3
 - New configuration property for setting the number of
   log records to keep in memory.

kSOAP_RemoteFW 3.0.2
 - Updated documentation and added xargs-file fragments that makes it
   easier to start using this feature.
 - All properties controlling this bundle can now be given as
   framework properties.
 - The RemoteFW implementation of BundleContext.getProperty() did not
   handle unset properties correctly (it now returns null as
   expected).
