Event 3.0.0
  Improved performance a lot by rewriting the whole mechanism for matching
  events to event handlers during event delivery. General clean up and
  removal of dead code.

Http 2.1.5
  
  Fixed problem with calls to HttpContext getMimeType(). The value of
  the name parameter was not the same as in the corresponding call to
  getResource() (the original URI path was used instead of the translated
  target resource name).

Knopflerfish Specific
----------------------------------------------

Console
 - Migration to new OSGi Standard (Done)

Desktop 3.0.10
 - Added menu action for resolving all selected bundles.
 - Added support for using options when starting and stopping bundles.
   E.g., a bundle may now be transiently started or stopped.
 - Menu and toolbar entries for starting, stopping, updating and
   uninstalling bundles are now disabled when no bundle is selected.
 - Changing start level for bundles now works when more than one
   bundle is selected.
 - Fixed a problem (dead-lock of the Event Dispatcher Thread) when
   calling the bundle life-cycle operations on the desktop bundle
   itself.
 - Fixed a number of issues when using the desktop with a
   RemoteFramework. E.g., the list of bundles shown was taken from
   the own (client) framework when it should have come from the remote
   (server) framework.


Framework Commands 3.0.3
 - Added support for using options when starting and stopping bundles.
   E.g., a bundle may now be transiently started or stopped.
 - New option "-a" (append) added to the 'cd' command.
 - New command 'properties' that may be used to list System and
   Framework properties.
 - New command 'threads' that may be used to list threads started by
   via the current framework.
 - The 'services' command has a new option "-sid 23" that only shows
   services with the specified service id.
 - The URL given to the 'formupdate' and 'frominstall' commands now
   uses the same set of base URLs as the 'install' command.

Log 2.0.3
 - New configuration property for setting the number of
   log records to keep in memory.

Log Commands 2.0.1
 - If a log entry includes a service reference print the service id
   in addition to the value of the object class property. 


kSOAP_RemoteFW 3.0.2
 - Updated documentation and added xargs-file fragments that makes it
   easier to start using this feature.
 - All properties controlling this bundle can now be given as
   framework properties.
 - The RemoteFW implementation of BundleContext.getProperty() did not
   handle unset properties correctly (it now returns null as
   expected).

axis_osgi 0.1.0.2
 - Do not use the bean-mapper for java.util.Date, java.util.Map and
   java.util.Vector since axis provides special mappers for these
   classes.

crimson - 2.1.0
 - updated to use 2008 version of OSGi's XMLParserActivator. Fixed
   so that bundle works together with java 1.4 system xml classes.

xerces - 2.10.0
 - updated to use 2008 version of OSGi's XMLParserActivator.
