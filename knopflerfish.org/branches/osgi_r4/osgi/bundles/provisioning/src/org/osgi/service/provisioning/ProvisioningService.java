/**
 * Service for managing the initial provisioning information.
 * <p>
 * Initial provisioning of an OSGi device is a multi step process that
 * culminates with the installation and execution of the initial management
 * agent.  At each step of the process, information is collected for the
 * next step.  Multiple bundles may be involved and this service provides
 * a means for these bundles to exchange information.  It also provides a
 * means for the initial Management Bundle to get its initial configuration
 * information.
 * <p>
 * The provisioning information is collected in a <tt>Dictionary</tt> object, called the Provisioning Dictionary.  Any bundle
 * that can access the service can get a reference to this object and 
 * read and update provisioning information.
 * The key of the dictionary is a
 * <tt>String</tt> object and the value is a <tt>String</tt> or 
 * <tt>byte[]</tt> object.  The single exception is the
 * PROVISIONING_UPDATE_COUNT value which is an Integer.
 * The <tt>provisioning</tt> prefix
 * is reserved for keys defined by OSGi, other key names may be used for
 * implementation dependent provisioning systems.
 * <p>
 * Any changes to the provisioning information will be reflected immediately
 * in all the dictionary objects obtained from the Provisioning Service. 
 * <p>
 * Because of the specific application of the Provisioning Service, there should
 * be only one Provisioning Service registered.  This restriction will not be
 * enforced by the Framework.  Gateway operators or manufactures should ensure
 * that a Provisioning Service bundle is not installed on a device that already
 * has a bundle providing the Provisioning Service.
 * <p>
 * The provisioning information has the potential to contain sensitive 
 * information.  Also, the ability to modify provisioning information can
 * have drastic consequences.  Thus, only trusted bundles should be allowed to
 * register and get the Provisioning Service.  The <tt>ServicePermission</tt> is
 * used to limit the bundles that can gain access to the 
 * Provisioning Service.  There is no check of <tt>Permission</tt> objects to read or
 * modify the provisioning information, so care must be taken not to leak the
 * Provisioning Dictionary received from <tt>getInformation</tt> method.
 * @version $Revision: 1.13 $
