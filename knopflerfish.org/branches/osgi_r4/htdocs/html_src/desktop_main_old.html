The Knopflerfish OSGi Desktop is a standard OSGi bundle, using Swing. Currently the desktop can only manage a framework running locally, so it is most useful for developing and testing bundles on a computer having a screen.
<p>
The Desktop bundle can be found in
<pre>
  knopflerfish/osgi/bundles/desktop
</pre>
<p>
When started, it creates a window with four main areas:
<dl>
  <dt>Toolbar
  <dd>The top toolbar provides quick access to common operations
    as start/stop/update bundles.
  <dt>Bundle view
  <dd>The center bundle view area display all installed bundles
    and their states. By clicking on bundles in this are,
    detail information is displayed in the <b>Bundle detail area</b>
    Three different views a supported:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#view_icons">Icons</a> - each bundle is displayed as an icon.
      <li><a href="#view_details">Details</a> - each bundle is displayed as a table row.
      <li><a href="#view_spin">Spin</a> - each bundle is displayed in a really cool graphics view.
    </ul>
  <dt>Bundle detail area
  <dd>The rightmost bundle detail area shows detailed
    information on selected bundles.
  <dt>Framework console
  <dd>The bottom console area allows interaction with the
    text console. This console acts exactly as the <tt>consoltty</tt> bundle, but does not require a shell or DOS window to run.
