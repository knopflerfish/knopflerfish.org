<h3>Installation instructions</h3>

<ol>
 <li>Unzip the distribution zip file in your eclipse directory. The following plug-ins are extracted
 to the plugins directory.
 <ul>
 <li>org.knopflerfish.eclipse.core
 <li>org.knopflerfish.eclipse.core.ui
 </ul>
</ol>



<h3>Getting started</h3>



<h4>Specify location of Knopflerfish distribution</h4>
Before developing bundles the location of a Knopflerfish installation must be specified. The information is saved 
in the Eclipse Preferences.

<ol>
 <li>Select Window/Preferences
 <li>In Preferences dialog select OSGi/Knopflerfish
 <li>Select to 'Add' a new Knopflerfish definition and enter 
 location of your Knopflerfish installation in the shown
 dialog page.
</ol>



<h4>Defining bundle sets</h4>
Bundle sets are used to group bundles into logical units, which later can be referred to when selecting bundles to 
deploy on a framework. Bundle set information is saved in the Eclipse Preferences.
<p>
<b>TODO:</b> Work in progress.
</p>


<h4>Creating a new bundle project</h4>

<ol>
 <li>Select File/New/Project...
 <li>Select Bundle Project and enter project info.
 <li>A new project is created. 
</ol>


<h4>Editing Bundle Manifest</h4>
Double click on the bundle.manifest file in your project. The file will be opened in a special editor, which has one tab 
for a graphical view of the manifest and one tab for a text view. Not all attributes can yet be set through the
graphical view, e.g. Import-Package, Export-Package etc. For now you will have to set these attributes in the text
view.

<p>
<b>TODO:</b> Add attributes to the graphical view and help setting them.
</p>

<h4>Using Services</h4>
This is not yet supported in the plugin. For now you will have to manually add the JAR file containing the service API 
to your classpath and also edit the bundle manifest Import-Package attribute, see above.

<p>
<b>TODO:</b> Support usage of services, by given the service package, automatically find bundle JARs exporting this 
package, add it to the build classpath and also update the manifest attribute Import-Package.
</p>


<h4>Debugging</h4>

<ol>
 <li>Select Run/Debug...
 <li>Create a new OSGi launch configuration
 <li>Select location where instance data for this launch
   shall be stored.
 <li>Select to 'Start empty platform'
 <li>Select the Bundle Tab
 <li>Set 'Manual Selection of bundles'
 <li>Add the bundles which shall be launched in this debug configuration.
</ol>


<h4>Packaging Bundle</h4>

<p>
<b>TODO:</b> Create help for packaging bundle. For now use the built in JAR file utility under 'File/Export.../JAR file'.
</p>
