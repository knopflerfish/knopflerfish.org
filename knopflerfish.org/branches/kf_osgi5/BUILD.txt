To build Knopflerfish from scratch you need:

 Java SE 6 (or 5).
    Java SE 7 or later can not be used since they do not support the
    javac target option "jsr14" which is needed to build code
    containing generics in a way that makes it is runnable on JDK 1.4
    and later (including Java SE 7).

 Ant 1.8.1 (or later)


Type "ant all" in this directory to build all bundles and test bundles.
