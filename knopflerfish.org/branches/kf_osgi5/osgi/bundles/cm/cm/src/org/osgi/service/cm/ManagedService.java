/**
 * A service that can receive configuration data from a Configuration Admin
 * service.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Managed Service is a service that needs configuration data. Such an object
 * should be registered with the Framework registry with the {@code service.pid}
 * property set to some unique identifier called a PID.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the Configuration Admin service has a {@code Configuration} object
 * corresponding to this PID, it will callback the {@code updated()} method of
 * the {@code ManagedService} object, passing the properties of that
 * {@code Configuration} object.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If it has no such {@code Configuration} object, then it calls back with a
 * {@code null} properties argument. Registering a Managed Service will always
 * result in a callback to the {@code updated()} method provided the
 * Configuration Admin service is, or becomes active. This callback must always
 * be done asynchronously.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Else, every time that either of the {@code updated()} methods is called on
 * that {@code Configuration} object, the {@code ManagedService.updated()}
 * method with the new properties is called. If the {@code delete()} method is
 * called on that {@code Configuration} object, {@code ManagedService.updated()}
 * is called with a {@code null} for the properties parameter. All these
 * callbacks must be done asynchronously.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The following example shows the code of a serial port that will create a port
 * depending on configuration information.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 
 *   class SerialPort implements ManagedService {
 *  
 *     ServiceRegistration registration;
 *     Hashtable configuration;
 *     CommPortIdentifier id;
 *  
 *     synchronized void open(CommPortIdentifier id,
 *     BundleContext context) {
 *       this.id = id;
 *       registration = context.registerService(
 *         ManagedService.class.getName(),
 *         this,
 *         getDefaults()
 *       );
 *     }
 *  
 *     Hashtable getDefaults() {
 *       Hashtable defaults = new Hashtable();
 *       defaults.put( &quot;port&quot;, id.getName() );
 *       defaults.put( &quot;product&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot; );
 *       defaults.put( &quot;baud&quot;, &quot;9600&quot; );
 *       defaults.put( Constants.SERVICE_PID,
 *         &quot;com.acme.serialport.&quot; + id.getName() );
 *       return defaults;
 *     }
 *  
 *     public synchronized void updated(
 *       Dictionary configuration  ) {
 *       if ( configuration == null )
 *         registration.setProperties( getDefaults() );
 *       else {
 *         setSpeed( configuration.get(&quot;baud&quot;) );
 *         registration.setProperties( configuration );
 *       }
 *     }
 *     ...
 *   }
 * 
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * As a convention, it is recommended that when a Managed Service is updated, it
 * should copy all the properties it does not recognize into the service
 * registration properties. This will allow the Configuration Admin service to
 * set properties on services which can then be used by other applications.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Normally, a single Managed Service for a given PID is given the configuration
 * dictionary, this is the configuration that is bound to the location of the
 * registering bundle. However, when security is on, a Managed Service can have
 * Configuration Permission to also be updated for other locations.

	 * Update the configuration for a Managed Service.

	 * <p>
	 * When the implementation of {@code updated(Dictionary)} detects any kind
	 * of error in the configuration properties, it should create a new
	 * {@code ConfigurationException} which describes the problem. This can
	 * allow a management system to provide useful information to a human

	 * <p>
	 * If this method throws any other {@code Exception}, the Configuration

	 * for a single configuration then the callbacks must occur in service
	 * ranking order. Changes in the location must be reflected by deleting the

	 * it becomes visible.
