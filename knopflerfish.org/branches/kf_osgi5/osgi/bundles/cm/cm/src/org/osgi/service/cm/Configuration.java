/**
 * The configuration information for a {@code ManagedService} or
 * {@code ManagedServiceFactory} object.
 * 
 * The Configuration Admin service uses this interface to represent the
 * configuration information for a {@code ManagedService} or for a service
 * instance of a {@code ManagedServiceFactory}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A {@code Configuration} object contains a configuration dictionary and allows
 * the properties to be updated via this object. Bundles wishing to receive
 * configuration dictionaries do not need to use this class - they register a
 * {@code ManagedService} or {@code ManagedServiceFactory}. Only administrative
 * bundles, and bundles wishing to update their own configurations need to use
 * this class.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The properties handled in this configuration have case insensitive
 * {@code String} objects as keys. However, case must be preserved from the last
 * set key/value.
 * <p>
 * A configuration can be <i>bound</i> to a specific bundle or to a region of
 * bundles using the <em>location</em>. In its simplest form the location is the
 * location of the target bundle that registered a Managed Service or a Managed
 * Service Factory. However, if the location starts with {@code ?} then the
 * location indicates multiple delivery. In such a case the configuration must
 * be delivered to all targets.
 * 
 * If security is on, the Configuration Permission can be used to restrict the
 * targets that receive updates. The Configuration Admin must only update a
 * target when the configuration location matches the location of the target's
 * bundle or the target bundle has a Configuration Permission with the action
 * {@link ConfigurationPermission#TARGET} and a name that matches the
 * configuration location. The name in the permission may contain wildcards (
 * {@code '*'}) to match the location using the same substring matching rules as
 * {@link Filter}.
 * 
 * Bundles can always create, manipulate, and be updated from configurations
 * that have a location that matches their bundle location.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If a configuration's location is {@code null}, it is not yet bound to a
 * location. It will become bound to the location of the first bundle that
 * registers a {@code ManagedService} or {@code ManagedServiceFactory} object
 * with the corresponding PID.
 * <p>
 * The same {@code Configuration} object is used for configuring both a Managed
 * Service Factory and a Managed Service. When it is important to differentiate
 * between these two the term "factory configuration" is used.
