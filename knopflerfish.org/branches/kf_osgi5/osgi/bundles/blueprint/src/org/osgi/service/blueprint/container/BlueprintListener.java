/**
 * A {@code BlueprintEvent} Listener.
 * 
 * <p>
 * To receive Blueprint Events, a bundle must register a Blueprint Listener
 * service.
 * 
 * After a Blueprint Listener is registered, the Blueprint extender must
 * synchronously send to this Blueprint Listener the last Blueprint Event for
 * each ready Blueprint bundle managed by this extender. This replay of
 * Blueprint Events is designed so that the new Blueprint Listener can be
 * informed of the state of each Blueprint bundle. Blueprint Events sent during
 * this replay will have the {@link BlueprintEvent#isReplay() isReplay()} flag
 * set. The Blueprint extender must ensure that this replay phase does not
 * interfere with new Blueprint Events so that the chronological order of all
 * Blueprint Events received by the Blueprint Listener is preserved. If the last
 * Blueprint Event for a given Blueprint bundle is
 * {@link BlueprintEvent#DESTROYED DESTROYED}, the extender must not send it
 * during this replay phase.
