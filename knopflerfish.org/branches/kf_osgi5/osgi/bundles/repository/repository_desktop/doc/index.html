  <p>The Knopflerfish OSGi Desktop Repository plug-in provides a bundle detail
  view for working with OSGi repositories. It support common operations
  like browsing repositories and installing a bundle from a
  repository. Future versions of this plugin will also work with OSGi
  resolver services to be able not only to install the selected bundle
  but also all its dependencies that are needed for the selected
  bundle to be fully functional.</p>


<h3>The Repository-desktop view</h3>

  <p>The view presents a tree view of all resources that are
  down-loadable bundles in the configured repositories. The tree
  supports a number of different ways to sort the bundles. The
  drop-down on the left in the tool-bar below the bundle tree can be
  used to change the sort order.</p>

  <p>The main part of the view (to the right of the bundle tree) shows
  details for the selected bundle. Here you can see the download URL,
  the size and a SHA-256 checksum for the bundle. You can also see all
  capabilities that the bundle provides and requires.</p>


<h3>The Repository-desktop view tool-bar</h3>

  <p>The tool.bar below the bundle tree on the left of the repository
  view provides buttons to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li> Change sort order in the bundle tree.
    <li> Rebuild the view with data from the available set of
         repository services.
    <li> Install the selected bundle.
    <li> Install and start the selected bundle.
    <li> Show a settings window to configure repositories.
  </ul>

  </a>
</div>

  <p>In the settings window you can configure the rank of a
  repository. The repositories are searched for resources in rank
  order, highest rank first.</p>

  <p>It is also possible to enable or disable a repository. A disabled
  repository is not searched when searching for bundle resources. Note
  that the enable / disable state only applies to the current
  "session".</p>
