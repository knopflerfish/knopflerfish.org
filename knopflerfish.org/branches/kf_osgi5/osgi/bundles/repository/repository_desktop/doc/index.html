  <p>The Knopflerfish OSGi Desktop CM plug-in provides a bundle detail
  view for managing OSGi configurations. It support common operations
  as create, update and delete for CM configurations. It can also
  import and export configurations using the <a
  href="../cm/cm_data.dtd">cm_data.dtd</a> XML document format.</p>

<h3>The CM-desktop view</h3>

  <p>The view presents configurations with associated metatype
  information for the selected bundle. In the top part of the view
  there will be two selectors, selecting which PID (configuration) to
  show. The upper selector selects amongst PIDs with accompanying
  metatype data (OCD, Object Class Definition) defining the set of
  properties (AD Attribute Definitions) that may be configured for the
  PID. The second selector selects Factory PIDs (configurations). For
  more information on metatype see chapter 105 in the OSGi Compendium
  Specification.</p>

  <p>The main part of the view shows one configuration with inputs for
  all the properties defined for it in its metatype description. On
  top there are controls for the CRUD-operations and if it is a
  factory PID that was selected there will be a drop down for
  selecting the instance of the factory PID to view and work with.</p>

  <p>A configuration instance can be targeted to a specific bundle by
  appending the actual PID with a target specification. It is possible
  to target configuration instances on
  <ul>
    <li>Bundle symbolic name.
    <li>Bundles symbolic name and version.
    <li>Bundles symbolic name, version and location.
  </ul> Controls for selecting the target level are available in the
  upper par of the main view.</p>

<h3>Special presentations</h3>

  </a>
</div>

  <p>If the system bundle is the selected bundle then this displayer
  will show the union of all PIDs defined by metatype information in
  all installed bundles.</p>

  <p>If the CM bundle is selected and the kf-metatype bundle is the
  provider of the MetaTypeService then this view will show all
  configurations present in CM. In this case metatype information is
  generated from the actual configuration data so it will not be as
  precise as the one obtained from metatype information in a bundle.

  <p>If no bundle is selected (or a bundle without any meta type
  information) then the view will display a page that informs about
  these special presentations, a list of all bundles with meta type
  information and an <em>Import...</em> button that will present a
  dialog for importing <a href="../cm/cm_data.dtd">cm_data.dtd</a> XML
  documents.</p>

<h3>The CM-desktop dependencies</h3>

  <p>The CM-Desktop needs the metatype API and an implementation of the
  MetaTypeService to work. These are provided by the
  <em>metatype</em>-bundle and the <em>kf_metatype</em> bundle.
