<h1>Preferences</h1>

<div class="abstract">
  The prefs bundle implements the 
  <a  target="_top" href="$(JAVADOCLINK)org/osgi/service/prefs/PreferencesService.html">
    OSGi Preferences service</a>
  that provides easy to use persistent storage of bundle data. 
</div>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  With Preferences, bundles can store data persistently. Data is stored
  as named values in a tree structure where each node can have any
  number of key-value pairs. For example, Preferences can be used by a
  bundle to store application and user settings. A bundle typically uses
  a number of preferences tree roots, one for system settings and one
  for each user's settings. 
</p>
<p>
  This component implements the OSGi Preferences service.
</p>
<p>
  Note that preferences are tied to a bundle. The OSGi service
  provides no way for a bundle to access the preferences of another
  bundle. Once fetched though, it is possible for one bundle to share
  its preferences with other bundles.
