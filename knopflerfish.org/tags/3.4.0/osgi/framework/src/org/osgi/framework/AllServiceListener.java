/**
 * A <code>ServiceEvent</code> listener that does not filter based upon
 * package wiring. <code>AllServiceListener</code> is a listener interface
 * that may be implemented by a bundle developer. When a
 * <code>ServiceEvent</code> is fired, it is synchronously delivered to an
 * <code>AllServiceListener</code>. The Framework may deliver
 * <code>ServiceEvent</code> objects to an <code>AllServiceListener</code>
 * out of order and may concurrently call and/or reenter an
 * <code>AllServiceListener</code>.
 * <p>
 * An <code>AllServiceListener</code> object is registered with the Framework
 * using the <code>BundleContext.addServiceListener</code> method.
 * <code>AllServiceListener</code> objects are called with a
 * <code>ServiceEvent</code> object when a service is registered, modified, or
 * is in the process of unregistering.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>ServiceEvent</code> object delivery to
 * <code>AllServiceListener</code> objects is filtered by the filter specified
 * when the listener was registered. If the Java Runtime Environment supports
 * permissions, then additional filtering is done. <code>ServiceEvent</code>
 * objects are only delivered to the listener if the bundle which defines the
 * listener object's class has the appropriate <code>ServicePermission</code>
 * to get the service using at least one of the named classes under which the
 * service was registered.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Unlike normal <code>ServiceListener</code> objects,
 * <code>AllServiceListener</code> objects receive all
 * <code>ServiceEvent</code> objects regardless of whether the package source
 * of the listening bundle is equal to the package source of the bundle that
 * registered the service. This means that the listener may not be able to cast
 * the service object to any of its corresponding service interfaces if the
 * service object is retrieved.
