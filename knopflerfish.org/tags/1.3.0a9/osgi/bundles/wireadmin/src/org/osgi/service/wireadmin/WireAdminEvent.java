/**
 * A Wire Admin Event.
 *
 * <p><tt>WireAdminEvent</tt> objects are delivered asynchronously to all
 * registered <tt>WireAdminListener</tt> service objects which specify an
 * interest in the <tt>WireAdminEvent</tt> type. However,
 * events must be delivered in chronological order with respect to each listener.
 * For example, a <tt>WireAdminEvent</tt> of type {@link #WIRE_CONNECTED}
 * must be delivered before a <tt>WireAdminEvent</tt> of type
 * {@link #WIRE_DISCONNECTED} for a particular <tt>Wire</tt> object.
 *
 * <p>A type code is used to identify the type of event. The following event types are
 * defined:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>{@link #WIRE_CREATED}
 *  <li>{@link #WIRE_CONNECTED}
 *  <li>{@link #WIRE_UPDATED}
 *  <li>{@link #WIRE_TRACE}
 *  <li>{@link #WIRE_DISCONNECTED}
 *  <li>{@link #WIRE_DELETED}
 *  <li>{@link #PRODUCER_EXCEPTION}
 *  <li>{@link #CONSUMER_EXCEPTION}
 * </ul>
 * Additional event types may be defined in the future.
 *
 * <p>Event type values must be unique and disjoint bit values.
 * Event types must be defined as a bit in a 32 bit integer and can thus be
 * bitwise OR'ed together.
 * <p>Security Considerations.
 * <tt>WireAdminEvent</tt> objects contain <tt>Wire</tt> objects.
 * Care must be taken in the sharing of <tt>Wire</tt> objects with other bundles.
