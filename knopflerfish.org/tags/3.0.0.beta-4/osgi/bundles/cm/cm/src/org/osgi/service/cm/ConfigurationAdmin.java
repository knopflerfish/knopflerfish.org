/**
 * Service for administering configuration data.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The main purpose of this interface is to store bundle configuration data
 * persistently. This information is represented in <code>Configuration</code>
 * objects. The actual configuration data is a <code>Dictionary</code> of
 * properties inside a <code>Configuration</code> object.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are two principally different ways to manage configurations. First
 * there is the concept of a Managed Service, where configuration data is
 * uniquely associated with an object registered with the service registry.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Next, there is the concept of a factory where the Configuration Admin service
 * will maintain 0 or more <code>Configuration</code> objects for a Managed
 * Service Factory that is registered with the Framework.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The first concept is intended for configuration data about "things/services"
 * whose existence is defined externally, e.g. a specific printer. Factories are
 * intended for "things/services" that can be created any number of times, e.g.
 * a configuration for a DHCP server for different networks.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Bundles that require configuration should register a Managed Service or a
 * Managed Service Factory in the service registry. A registration property
 * named <code>service.pid</code> (persistent identifier or PID) must be used to
 * identify this Managed Service or Managed Service Factory to the Configuration
 * Admin service.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When the ConfigurationAdmin detects the registration of a Managed Service, it
 * checks its persistent storage for a configuration object whose
 * <code>service.pid</code> property matches the PID service property (
 * <code>service.pid</code>) of the Managed Service. If found, it calls
 * {@link ManagedService#updated} method with the new properties. The
 * implementation of a Configuration Admin service must run these call-backs
 * asynchronously to allow proper synchronization.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When the Configuration Admin service detects a Managed Service Factory
 * registration, it checks its storage for configuration objects whose
 * <code>service.factoryPid</code> property matches the PID service property of
 * the Managed Service Factory. For each such <code>Configuration</code>
 * objects, it calls the <code>ManagedServiceFactory.updated</code> method
 * asynchronously with the new properties. The calls to the <code>updated</code>
 * method of a <code>ManagedServiceFactory</code> must be executed sequentially
 * and not overlap in time.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In general, bundles having permission to use the Configuration Admin service
 * can only access and modify their own configuration information. Accessing or
 * modifying the configuration of another bundle requires
 * <code>ConfigurationPermission[*,CONFIGURE]</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>Configuration</code> objects can be <i>bound </i> to a specified bundle
 * location. In this case, if a matching Managed Service or Managed Service
 * Factory is registered by a bundle with a different location, then the
 * Configuration Admin service must not do the normal callback, and it should
 * log an error. In the case where a <code>Configuration</code> object is not
 * bound, its location field is <code>null</code>, the Configuration Admin
 * service will bind it to the location of the bundle that registers the first
 * Managed Service or Managed Service Factory that has a corresponding PID
 * property. When a <code>Configuration</code> object is bound to a bundle
 * location in this manner, the Configuration Admin service must detect if the
 * bundle corresponding to the location is uninstalled. If this occurs, the
 * <code>Configuration</code> object is unbound, that is its location field is
 * set back to <code>null</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The method descriptions of this class refer to a concept of "the calling
 * bundle". This is a loose way of referring to the bundle which obtained the
 * Configuration Admin service from the service registry. Implementations of
 * <code>ConfigurationAdmin</code> must use a
 * {@link org.osgi.framework.ServiceFactory} to support this concept.
