/**
 * An installed bundle in the Framework.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A <code>Bundle</code> object is the access point to define the lifecycle of
 * an installed bundle. Each bundle installed in the OSGi environment must have
 * an associated <code>Bundle</code> object.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A bundle must have a unique identity, a <code>long</code>, chosen by the
 * Framework. This identity must not change during the lifecycle of a bundle,
 * even when the bundle is updated. Uninstalling and then reinstalling the
 * bundle must create a new unique identity.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A bundle can be in one of six states:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #UNINSTALLED}
 * <li>{@link #INSTALLED}
 * <li>{@link #RESOLVED}
 * <li>{@link #STARTING}
 * <li>{@link #STOPPING}
 * <li>{@link #ACTIVE}
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Values assigned to these states have no specified ordering; they represent
 * bit values that may be ORed together to determine if a bundle is in one of
 * the valid states.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A bundle should only execute code when its state is one of
 * <code>STARTING</code>,<code>ACTIVE</code>, or <code>STOPPING</code>.
 * An <code>UNINSTALLED</code> bundle can not be set to another state; it is a
 * zombie and can only be reached because references are kept somewhere.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The Framework is the only entity that is allowed to create
 * <code>Bundle</code> objects, and these objects are only valid within the
 * Framework that created them.
