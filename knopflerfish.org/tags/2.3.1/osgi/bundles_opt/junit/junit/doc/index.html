<h1>JUnit on OSGI</h1>

Bundles to support JUnit testing on a running framework. 
<p>
There are three bundles involved:
<dl> 
<dt>junit
<dd>   bundle exporting the junit.framework.* classes
   as well as allowing remote connection to test suites
   in a running framework via http. This bundle also 
   exports a JUnitService to allow other bundles in
   the framework access to bundles.

<dt> junit_runner
<dd>    a bundle which automatically finds and runs
    bundles in a framework. This bundle does 
    not require any http connection, just the
    junit bundle. See junit_runner/readme.txt
    for more info.

<dt> examples
<dd>    some small test cases using junit
</dl>

<h2>Requirements:</h2>

The junit bundle does not require any other bundles (as of revision 737)
but can use the HTTP server and the KF console to make test access easier.
<ul>
<li> - optionally http server (used dynically by the server part)

<li> - optionally KF console (used dynamically by the server part)

<li> - XML parser (used by the client part)
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>

JUnit allows developers to write unit tests by writing classes 
implementing junit.framework.Test, e.g TestCase, TestSuite etc.
<p>
A typical test looks like
<pre>
 class MyTest extends junit.framework.TestCase {
   public void runTest() {
     ... do some work
     assertTrue(someflag)
   }
 }
</pre>
As long as these test do not depend on a running framework, they
are easy to run using normal tools, but when they depend on the
framework, the standard test running tools become insufficient.
<p>
Thus, the junit bundle allows remote access to test cases running
on a framework, from any normal test tool running on a developer 
machine.

<h2>How it works</h2>
<ol> 
<li>Bundle developers write tests for a bundle B just as any other 
    JUnit tests. The tests simply extends TestCase or TestSuite.

<li>The bundle developer register these tests as-is into the OSGi
    framework, with a service.pid property giving the name
    of the test. This should normally be the same name as the
    test. Typically all tests from a bundle is grouped into
    a TestSuite.
<p>
    Example: register a test suite into the framework.
<pre>
      TestSuite suite = new TestSuite("example1");

      suite.addTest(new MyTest());
      Hashtable props = new Hashtable();
      props.put("service.pid", suite.getName());
    
      bc.registerService(Test.class.getName(), suite, props);
</pre>

<li>The junit bundle, when started, registers a servlet in the
    OSGi web server, if the web server exists. This servlet then 
    allows remote running of the registered test cases.

    The servlet is available at
<pre>
      http://<host>:<port>/junit?id=<testid>
</pre>
    where <testid> == value of the service.pid property exported
    in 2) 
<p>
    The only interface that registered tests need to implement
    is junit.framework.Test
<P>
    The junit bundle thus accesses the tests via BundleContext.getService()
    and needs ServicePermission, if FW security is active.
<p>
 Note how *only* step 2) is extra work compared to writing standard
 JUnit tests.



<li>When actual testing is desired, a single client test class is used
    on the development machine (which doesn't need to run the framework!)
<p>
    The client class name is:
<pre>
     org.knopflerfish.service.junit.client.JUnitClient
</pre>
    The target host and test id is passed to the client as a 
    system property "suite.url"
<p>
    This client test class extends TestSuite and act as a proxy to the 
    actual test, and can thus be passed to any test runner, as
<p>
     junit.swingui.TestRunner or
     junit.textui.TestRunner
<p>
   as well as Ant's "junit" task.
<p>
   Example: Using the Swing TestRunner
<pre>
    > java "-Dsuite.url=http://localhost:8080/junit?id=example1" \
       junit.swingui.TestRunner \
       org.knopflerfish.service.junit.client.JUnitClient
</pre>
    This will run the test with id "example1" on localhost:8080
<p>
    Note that the class path must be set fo find both junit.jar and
    the junit_all-1.0.0.jar bundle.

<li>Testing can also be done without using the servlet. The easiest
    approach is then to use the junit_runner bundle, and provide it with
    a list of test IDs to run. XML formatted results will then be
    written to file.

<li>If you are using the KF console, the junit bundle registers
    a set of commands to list and run test cases.
<pre>
    > enter junit
    junit> help
    Available junit commands:
     list [-help]  - List available tests
     run [-help] [-out #file#] <id> - Run a test and dump XML results 
                                      to a file or console.
</pre>
</ol>

<b>Note1:</b><br>
<p>
  The servlet is also capable of exporting the test results as plain
  HTML. In this case, the client proxy isn't needed. Just point your
  browser at
<pre>
   http://<host>:<port>/junit
</pre>
  and you'll get a list of available tests. From this list you can
  select suites and individual tests to run. The result will be
  presented as HTML.

<b>Note2: </b><br>

  The junit_runner/resource directory contains som XSLT style
  sheets which may be useful for formatting XML test results to
  HTML.
 

<h2>JUnit support in bundlebuild.xml</h2>
----------------------------------------

As a convenience, the ant/bundlebuild.xml script
contains support for using the JUnit client.

<p>
Example: run the swing Test runner from Ant
<pre>
   > ant -Dtest.id=example1 junit_ext
</pre>
   
Example: run Ant's junit task
<pre>
   > ant -Dtest.id=example1 junit_ant
</pre>

Tip: Bundles can be installed using the telnet console. The telnet
console is installed by the default init.xargs. In this case a bundle
can be installed and started by
<pre>
   > ant install start
</pre>     

The following Ant properties are set as default in bundlebuild.xml:
<pre>
  http.host              localhost
  http.port              8080
  junit.runner.class     junit.swingui.TestRunner
  junit.formatter        plain
  junit.outfile          junit
</pre>

<h2>Known issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>TestSuites are "flattened" by the client proxy, so the
   tree structure in the Swing runner might look a bit different
   compared from tests run locally.

<li> Proxied tests cannot (yet) be individually re-run. The entire client 
   proxy must be re-run
</ul>
