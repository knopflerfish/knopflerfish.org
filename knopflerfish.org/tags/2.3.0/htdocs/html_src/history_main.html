The sun was hot on the Madagascar djungle. While S had not been able to 
find anyone human for several days, he was sure he could handle the
heat and humidity until sunset. After that, he might use his last flare
to attract attention from one of the ever-watchful satellites.
</p>
<p>
As the last rays of light quickly disappeared behind the giant trees, S 
felt something sharp dig into his foot. He couldn't keep himself from
falling forward, and realized with horror that the sharp object had ripped
up his entire left arm.
</p>
<p>
In the fossilized remains of <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Galaxy/8152/direstraits.html"><i>Masiakasaurus knopfleri</i></a>'s teeth, he pulled 
the trigger on the flare and hoped for rescue.

Yes! Yet another dead guitarist", exclaimed K while trying to avoid
drinking his coffee. "As we didn't have enough already".
</p>

<p>
"Well", E said, "why don't you come up with something better?" Something
that makes you feel happy. Something that never will go out of fashion.
</p>
<p>
"A fish?" K instantly replied.
