/**
 * A Monitoring Job is a request for scheduled or event based notifications on
 * update of a set of <code>StatusVariable</code>s. The job is a data structure
 * that holds a non-empty list of <code>StatusVariable</code> names, an
 * identification of the initiator of the job, and the sampling parameters.
 * There are two kinds of monitoring jobs: time based and change based. Time
 * based jobs take samples of all <code>StatusVariable</code>s with a specified
 * frequency. The number of samples to be taken before the job finishes may be
 * specified. Change based jobs are only interested in the changes of the
 * monitored <code>StatusVariable</code>s. In this case, the number of changes
 * that must take place between two notifications can be specified.
 * <p>
 * The job can be started on the <code>MonitorAdmin</code> interface. Running
 * the job (querying the <code>StatusVariable</code>s, listening to changes, and
 * sending out notifications on updates) is the task of the
 * <code>MonitorAdmin</code> implementation.
 * <p>
 * Whether a monitoring job keeps track dynamically of the
 * <code>StatusVariable</code>s it monitors is not specified. This means that if
 * we monitor a <code>StatusVariable</code> of a <code>Monitorable</code>
 * service which disappears and later reappears then it is implementation
 * specific whether we still receive updates of the <code>StatusVariable</code>
 * changes or not.
