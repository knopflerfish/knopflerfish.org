/**
 * Listener for Wire Admin Events.
 *
 * <p><tt>WireAdminListener</tt> objects are registered with the Framework service registry and
 * are notified with a <tt>WireAdminEvent</tt> object when an event
 * is broadcast.
 * <p><tt>WireAdminListener</tt> objects can inspect the received <tt>WireAdminEvent</tt> object to
 * determine its type, the <tt>Wire</tt> object with which it is associated, and the Wire Admin service that
 * broadcasts the event.
 *
 * <p><tt>WireAdminListener</tt> objects must be registered with a
 * service property {@link WireConstants#WIREADMIN_EVENTS}
 * whose value is a bitwise OR of all the event types the listener
 * is interested in receiving.
 * <p>For example:
 * <pre>
 *  Integer mask = new Integer( WIRE_TRACE
 *   | WIRE_CONNECTED
 *   | WIRE_DISCONNECTED );
 *  Hashtable ht = new Hashtable();
 *  ht.put( WIREADMIN_EVENTS, mask );
 *  context.registerService( 
 *     WireAdminListener.class.getName(), this, ht );
 * </pre>
 * If a <tt>WireAdminListener</tt> object is registered without a
 * service property {@link WireConstants#WIREADMIN_EVENTS},
 * then the <tt>WireAdminListener</tt> will receive no events.
 *
 * <p>Security Considerations. Bundles wishing to monitor <tt>WireAdminEvent</tt> objects
 * will require <tt>ServicePermission[REGISTER,WireAdminListener]</tt> to register a <tt>WireAdminListener</tt> service.
 * Since <tt>WireAdminEvent</tt> objects contain <tt>Wire</tt> objects, care must be taken
 * in assigning permission to register a <tt>WireAdminListener</tt> service.
