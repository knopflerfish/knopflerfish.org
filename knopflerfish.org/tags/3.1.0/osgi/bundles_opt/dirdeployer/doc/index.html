<h1>Directory deployer</h1>

<p>
Simple bundle which scans file system directories and
installs/uninstalls bundles found or removed from these directories.
</p>

<p>
This is a quite useful tool for handle bundle deployment without using any 
console. Just copy the bundles that should be started to the deploy 
directory, and the directory deployer will find and start them. When the 
files are removed, they are uninstalled.
</p>

<h2>Deploy method</h2>

<p>The procedure for scanning and deploying is as follows:

<ol>
  <li>
      Check if any new files have appeared or if any already deployed
      files has been replaced with newer files.
  </li>

  <li>
      New files are installed into the framework.<br> If they are not
      fragment bundles, they are marked for start at the end of the
      scan.<br> Files newer than a previously deployed bundle are
      updated.
  </li>

  <li>
      Files that have the same location as an already installed bundle
      is not installed again, instead, the installed bundle is re-used
      in the created DeployedFile instance.
  </li>

  <li>
      Check if there are bundle installed by the directory deployer
      that does not correspond to a file found during the directory
      scan. If such bundles are found uninstall them.
  </li>

  <li>
      If any bundle update was performed during the scan, perform a
      refresh packages operation for them using the in the package
      admin service.
  </li>

  <li>
      Files marked for start are started.
  </li>

  <li>
      Sleep a while
  </li>

  <li>
      Repeat from 1.
  </li>

</ol>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>
See <a href="$(SVN_REPO_URL)/$(SVN_TAG)/osgi/bundles_opt/dirdeployer/resources/metatype.xml">metatype.xml</a>
for specification using CM. The same properties as defined by CM are
also read as default values from framework properties. Thus, the
bundle can be both configured by CM and using system properties.
</p>
<p>
Quick guide to the metatype.xml format:
<ul>
 <li>Top level <tt>xsd:complexType</tt> is service PIDs</li>
 <li><tt>xsd:element</tt> is a property</li>
 <li><tt>metatype:values</tt> defines default values</li>
</ul>
For details on the metatype format, see <a
href="http://www.knopflerfish.org/XMLMetatype">http://www.knopflerfish.org/XMLMetatype/</a>

<p>You can set the deployment directory in <tt>metatype.xml</tt> in
the bundle's resource directory (defaults to <tt>./load</tt>). A
relative deployment directory path is relative to the directory from
which the framework is started.</p>

The table below describes the framework properties that may be used to
set the default values for the directory deployer configuration.
