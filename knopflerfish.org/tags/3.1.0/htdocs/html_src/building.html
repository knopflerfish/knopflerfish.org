<h2>Building Knopflerfish</h2>

Knopflerfish includes an ant based build system for building a complete Knopflerfish distribution as well as building 
<a href="/releases/current/docs/programming.html">individual bundles</a>. Ant 1.7 or later is required, available from <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">ant.apache.org</a>

<p>
Knopflerfish can be built either by 
 <a href="svn_info.html">
   checking out the entire source code
</a>,
or by (re)building an installed distribution.
</p>
<p>
 The top level build file is located in the <tt>osgi</tt>
 directory. The default target is to build the framework and all
 bundles in the bundles directory.
</p>
<p>
Invoking ant with the -p option will display the possible targets.
