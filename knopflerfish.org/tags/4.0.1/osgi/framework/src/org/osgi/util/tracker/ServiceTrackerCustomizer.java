/**
 * The {@code ServiceTrackerCustomizer} interface allows a
 * {@code ServiceTracker} to customize the service objects that are
 * tracked. A {@code ServiceTrackerCustomizer} is called when a service is
 * being added to a {@code ServiceTracker}. The
 * {@code ServiceTrackerCustomizer} can then return an object for the
 * tracked service. A {@code ServiceTrackerCustomizer} is also called when
 * a tracked service is modified or has been removed from a
 * {@code ServiceTracker}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The methods in this interface may be called as the result of a
 * {@code ServiceEvent} being received by a {@code ServiceTracker}.
 * Since {@code ServiceEvent}s are synchronously delivered by the
 * Framework, it is highly recommended that implementations of these methods do
 * not register ({@code BundleContext.registerService}), modify (
 * {@code ServiceRegistration.setProperties}) or unregister (
 * {@code ServiceRegistration.unregister}) a service while being
 * synchronized on any object.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The {@code ServiceTracker} class is thread-safe. It does not call a
 * {@code ServiceTrackerCustomizer} while holding any locks.
 * {@code ServiceTrackerCustomizer} implementations must also be
 * thread-safe.
 * 
 * @param <S> The type of the service being tracked.
 * @param <T> The type of the tracked object.
