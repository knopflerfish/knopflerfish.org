/**
 * UPnP Events are mapped and delivered to applications according to the OSGi
 * whiteboard model. An application that wishes to be notified of events
 * generated by a particular UPnP Device registers a service extending this
 * interface.
 * <p>
 * The notification call from the UPnP Service to any <code>UPnPEventListener</code>
 * object must be done asynchronous with respect to the originator (in a
 * separate thread).
 * <p>
 * Upon registration of the UPnP Event Listener service with the Framework, the
 * service is notified for each variable which it listens for with an initial
 * event containing the current value of the variable. Subsequent notifications
 * only happen on changes of the value of the variable.
 * <p>
 * A UPnP Event Listener service filter the events it receives. This event set
 * is limited using a standard framework filter expression which is specified
 * when the listener service is registered.
 * <p>
 * The filter is specified in a property named "upnp.filter" and has as a value
 * an object of type <code>org.osgi.framework.Filter</code>.
 * <p>
 * When the Filter is evaluated, the folowing keywords are recognized as defined
 * as literal constants in the <code>UPnPDevice</code> class.
 * <p>
 * The valid subset of properties for the registration of UPnP Event Listener
 * services are:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>UPnPDevice.TYPE</code>-- Which type of device to listen for events.
 * </li>
 * <li><code>UPnPDevice.ID</code>-- The ID of a specific device to listen for
 * events.</li>
 * <li><code>UPnPService.TYPE</code>-- The type of a specific service to listen
 * for events.</li>
 * <li><code>UPnPService.ID</code>-- The ID of a specific service to listen for
 * events.</li>
 * </ul>
