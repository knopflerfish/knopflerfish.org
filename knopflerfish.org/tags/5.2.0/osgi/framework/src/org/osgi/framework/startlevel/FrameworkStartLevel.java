	 * complete. When the start level change completes normally, each specified
	 * {@code FrameworkListener} will be called with a Framework event of type

	 * target start level, the Framework must:
	 * <ol>
	 * <li>Change the active start level to the intermediate start level value.
	 * <li>Start bundles at the intermediate start level whose autostart setting
	 * indicate they must be started. They are started as described in the

	 * option. The {@link Bundle#START_ACTIVATION_POLICY} option must also be
	 * used if {@link BundleStartLevel#isActivationPolicyUsed()} returns
	 * {@code true} for the bundle.
	 * </ol>
	 * When this process completes after the specified start level is reached,
	 * the Framework will fire a Framework event of type
	 * {@code FrameworkEvent.STARTLEVEL_CHANGED} to announce it has moved to the
	 * specified start level.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * If the specified start level is lower than the active start level, the
	 * Framework will continue to decrease the start level until the Framework
	 * has reached the specified start level.
	 * 
	 * At each intermediate start level value on the way to and including the
	 * specified start level, the framework must:
	 * <ol>
	 * <li>Stop bundles at the intermediate start level as described in the
	 * {@link Bundle#stop(int)} method using the {@link Bundle#STOP_TRANSIENT}
	 * option.
	 * <li>Change the active start level to the intermediate start level value.
	 * </ol>
	 * When this process completes after the specified start level is reached,
	 * the Framework will fire a Framework event of type

	 * specified start level.

	 * <p>
	 * If the specified start level is equal to the active start level, then no
	 * bundles are started or stopped, however, the Framework must fire a
	 * Framework event of type {@code FrameworkEvent.STARTLEVEL_CHANGED} to
	 * announce it has finished moving to the specified start level. This event
	 * may arrive before this method returns.
	 * 
	 * @param startlevel The requested start level for the Framework.

	 *        need to be otherwise registered with the framework. If a specified

	 *        notified twice.
	 * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the specified start level is less
	 *         than or equal to zero.
