	 * Resolve the specified resolve context and return any new resources and

	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The resolver considers two groups of resources:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>Mandatory - any resource in the
	 * {@link ResolveContext#getMandatoryResources() mandatory group} must be
	 * resolved. A failure to satisfy any mandatory requirement for these
	 * resources will result in throwing a {@link ResolutionException}</li>
	 * <li>Optional - any resource in the
	 * {@link ResolveContext#getOptionalResources() optional group} may be
	 * resolved. A failure to satisfy a mandatory requirement for a resource in
	 * this group will not fail the overall resolution but no resources or wires
	 * will be returned for that resource.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The resolve method returns the delta between the start state defined by
	 * {@link ResolveContext#getWirings()} and the end resolved state. That is,
	 * only new resources and wires are included.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The behavior of the resolver is not defined if the specified resolve
	 * context supplies inconsistent information.
	 * 
	 * @param context The resolve context for the resolve operation. Must not be
	 *        {@code null}.
	 * @return The new resources and wires required to satisfy the specified
	 *         resolve context. The returned map is the property of the caller
	 *         and can be modified by the caller.
	 * @throws ResolutionException If the resolution cannot be satisfied.
