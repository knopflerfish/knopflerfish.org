/**
 * A connection between a Producer service and a Consumer service.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A {@code Wire} object connects a Producer service to a Consumer service. Both
 * the Producer and Consumer services are identified by their unique
 * {@code service.pid} values. The Producer and Consumer services may
 * communicate with each other via {@code Wire} objects that connect them. The
 * Producer service may send updated values to the Consumer service by calling
 * the {@link #update(Object)} method. The Consumer service may request an
 * updated value from the Producer service by calling the {@link #poll()}
 * method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Producer service and a Consumer service may be connected through multiple
 * {@code Wire} objects.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Security Considerations. {@code Wire} objects are available to Producer and
 * Consumer services connected to a given {@code Wire} object and to bundles
 * which can access the {@code WireAdmin} service. A bundle must have
 * {@code ServicePermission[WireAdmin,GET]} to get the {@code WireAdmin} service
 * to access all {@code Wire} objects. A bundle registering a Producer service
 * or a Consumer service must have the appropriate
 * {@code ServicePermission[Consumer|Producer,REGISTER]} to register the service
 * and will be passed {@code Wire} objects when the service object's
 * {@code consumersConnected} or {@code producersConnected} method is called.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Scope. Each Wire object can have a scope set with the {@code setScope}
 * method. This method should be called by a Consumer service when it assumes a
 * Producer service that is composite (supports multiple information items). The
 * names in the scope must be verified by the {@code Wire} object before it is
 * used in communication. The semantics of the names depend on the Producer
 * service and must not be interpreted by the Wire Admin service.
