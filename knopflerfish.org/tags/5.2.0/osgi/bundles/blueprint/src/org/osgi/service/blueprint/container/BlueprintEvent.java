/**
 * A Blueprint Event.
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@code BlueprintEvent} objects are delivered to all registered
 * {@link BlueprintListener} services. Blueprint Events must be asynchronously
 * delivered in chronological order with respect to each listener.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In addition, after a Blueprint Listener is registered, the Blueprint extender
 * will synchronously send to this Blueprint Listener the last Blueprint Event
 * for each ready Blueprint bundle managed by this extender. This
 * <em>replay</em> of Blueprint Events is designed so that the new Blueprint
 * Listener can be informed of the state of each Blueprint bundle. Blueprint
 * Events sent during this replay will have the {@link #isReplay()} flag set.
 * The Blueprint extender must ensure that this replay phase does not interfere
 * with new Blueprint Events so that the chronological order of all Blueprint
 * Events received by the Blueprint Listener is preserved. If the last Blueprint
 * Event for a given Blueprint bundle is {@link #DESTROYED}, the extender must
 * not send it during this replay phase.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A type code is used to identify the type of event. The following event types
 * are defined:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #CREATING}</li>
 * <li>{@link #CREATED}</li>
 * <li>{@link #DESTROYING}</li>
 * <li>{@link #DESTROYED}</li>
 * <li>{@link #FAILURE}</li>
 * <li>{@link #GRACE_PERIOD}</li>
 * <li>{@link #WAITING}</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In addition to calling the registered {@link BlueprintListener} services, the
 * Blueprint extender must also send those events to the Event Admin service, if
 * it is available.
