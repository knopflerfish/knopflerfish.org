/**
 * Synchronous Listener for Configuration Events. When a
 * {@code ConfigurationEvent} is fired, it is synchronously delivered to a
 * {@code SynchronousConfigurationListener}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@code SynchronousConfigurationListener} objects are registered with the
 * Framework service registry and are synchronously notified with a
 * {@code ConfigurationEvent} object when an event is fired.
 * <p>
 * {@code SynchronousConfigurationListener} objects can inspect the received
 * {@code ConfigurationEvent} object to determine its type, the PID of the
 * {@code Configuration} object with which it is associated, and the
 * Configuration Admin service that fired the event.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Security Considerations. Bundles wishing to synchronously monitor
 * configuration events will require
 * {@code ServicePermission[SynchronousConfigurationListener,REGISTER]} to
 * register a {@code SynchronousConfigurationListener} service.
