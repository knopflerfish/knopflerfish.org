/**
 * A service interface for processing configuration dictionary before the
 * update.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A bundle registers a {@code ConfigurationPlugin} object in order to process
 * configuration updates before they reach the Managed Service or Managed
 * Service Factory. The Configuration Admin service will detect registrations of
 * Configuration Plugin services and must call these services every time before
 * it calls the {@code ManagedService} or {@code ManagedServiceFactory}
 * {@code updated} method. The Configuration Plugin service thus has the
 * opportunity to view and modify the properties before they are passed to the
 * Managed Service or Managed Service Factory.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Configuration Plugin (plugin) services have full read/write access to all
 * configuration information that passes through them.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The {@code Integer} {@code service.cmRanking} registration property may be
 * specified. Not specifying this registration property, or setting it to
 * something other than an {@code Integer}, is the same as setting it to the
 * {@code Integer} zero. The {@code service.cmRanking} property determines the
 * order in which plugins are invoked. Lower ranked plugins are called before
 * higher ranked ones. In the event of more than one plugin having the same
 * value of {@code service.cmRanking}, then the Configuration Admin service
 * arbitrarily chooses the order in which they are called.
 * 
 * <p>
 * By convention, plugins with {@code service.cmRanking < 0} or
 * {@code service.cmRanking > 1000} should not make modifications to the
 * properties.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The Configuration Admin service has the right to hide properties from
 * plugins, or to ignore some or all the changes that they make. This might be
 * done for security reasons. Any such behavior is entirely implementation
 * defined.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A plugin may optionally specify a {@code cm.target} registration property
 * whose value is the PID of the Managed Service or Managed Service Factory
 * whose configuration updates the plugin is intended to intercept. The plugin
 * will then only be called with configuration updates that are targeted at the
 * Managed Service or Managed Service Factory with the specified PID. Omitting
 * the {@code cm.target} registration property means that the plugin is called
 * for all configuration updates.
