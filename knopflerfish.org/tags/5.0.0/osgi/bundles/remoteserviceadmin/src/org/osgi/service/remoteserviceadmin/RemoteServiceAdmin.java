	 * Export a service to a given Endpoint. The Remote Service Admin must
	 * create an Endpoint from the given description that can be used by other
	 * Distribution Providers to connect to this Remote Service Admin and use
	 * the exported service.
	 * 
	 * The property keys of a Service Reference are case insensitive while the
	 * property keys of the specified {@code properties} map are case sensitive.
	 * A property key in the specified {@code properties} map must therefore
	 * override any case variant property key in the properties of the specified
	 * Service Reference.

	 * If the caller does not have the appropriate
	 * {@code EndpointPermission[endpoint,EXPORT]} for an Endpoint, and the Java
	 * Runtime Environment supports permissions, then the
	 * {@link ExportRegistration#getException() getException} method on the
	 * corresponding returned {@link ExportRegistration} will return a
	 * {@code SecurityException}.
	 * 
	 * @param reference The Service Reference to export.
	 * @param properties The properties to create a local Endpoint that can be
	 *        implemented by this Remote Service Admin. If this is {@code null},
	 *        the Endpoint will be determined by the properties on the service.
	 *        The properties are the same as given for an exported service. They
	 *        override any properties in the specified Service Reference (case
	 *        insensitive). The properties {@code objectClass} and

	 *        properties in the Service Reference cannot be overridden. This
	 *        parameter can be {@code null}, this should be treated as an empty
	 *        map.
	 * @return A {@code Collection} of {@link ExportRegistration}s for the
	 *         specified Service Reference and properties. Multiple Export
	 *         Registrations may be returned because a single service can be
	 *         exported to multiple Endpoints depending on the available
	 *         configuration type properties. The result is never {@code null}
	 *         but may be empty if this Remove Service Admin does not recognize
	 *         any of the configuration types.
	 * @throws IllegalArgumentException If any of the properties has a value
	 *         that is not syntactically correct or if the service properties
	 *         and the overlaid properties do not contain a
	 *         {@link RemoteConstants#SERVICE_EXPORTED_INTERFACES} entry.
	 * @throws UnsupportedOperationException If any of the intents expressed
	 *         through the properties is not supported by the distribution
	 *         provider.
