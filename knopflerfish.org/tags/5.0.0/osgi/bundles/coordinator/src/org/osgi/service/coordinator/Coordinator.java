/**
 * A Coordinator service coordinates activities between different parties.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A bundle can use the Coordinator service to create {@link Coordination}
 * objects. Once a Coordination object is created, it can be
 * {@link Coordination#push() pushed} on the thread local Coordination stack to
 * be an implicit parameter as the current Coordination for calls to other
 * parties, or it can be passed directly to other parties as an argument. The
 * current Coordination, which is on the top of the current thread's thread
 * local Coordination stack, can be obtained with {@link #peek()}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Any active Coordinations created by a bundle must be terminated when the
 * bundle releases the Coordinator service. The Coordinator service must
 * {@link Coordination#fail(Throwable) fail} these Coordinations with the
 * {@link Coordination#RELEASED RELEASED} exception.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A {@link Participant} can {@link Coordination#addParticipant(Participant)
 * register} to participate in a Coordination and receive notification of the
 * termination of the Coordination.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The following example code shows a example usage of the Coordinator service.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * void foo() {
 *   Coordination c = coordinator.begin(&quot;work&quot;, 0);
 *   try {
 *     doWork();
 *   } catch (Exception e) {
 *     c.fail(e);
 *   } finally {
 *     c.end();
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * In the {@code doWork} method, code can be called that requires notification
 * of the termination of the Coordination. The {@code doWork} method can then
 * register a Participant with the Coordination.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * void doWork() {
 *   if (coordinator.addParticipant(this)) {
 *     beginWork();
 *   } else {
 *     beginWork();
 *     finishWork();
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * void ended(Coordination c) {
 *   finishWork();
 * }
 * 
 * void failed(Coordination c) {
 *   undoWork();
 * }
 * </pre>
