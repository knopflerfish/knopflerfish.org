<h1>SOAP Object</h1>

<div class="abstract">
This is an example of a server side SOAP object.
</div>

<p> The bundle is part of the <a href="../soap/index.html#axis1">The
Knopflerfish Axis 1</a> package.  </p>


<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
The soapobject bundle installs a service object into the service registry and
sets its SOAP_SERVICE_NAME property to "remoteFW". This will make the axis-osgi
bundle (must be run prior to start of the soapobject bundle) create an Axis 
SOAP service named "remoteFW". Use the following URLs from a Web browser to 
explore the service.
