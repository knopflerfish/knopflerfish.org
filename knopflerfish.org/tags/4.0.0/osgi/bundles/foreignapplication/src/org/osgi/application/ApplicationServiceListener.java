/**
 * An <code>ApplicationServiceEvent</code> listener. When a 
 * <code>ServiceEvent</code> is
 * fired, it is converted to an <code>ApplictionServiceEvent</code>
 * and it is synchronously delivered to an <code>ApplicationServiceListener</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>ApplicationServiceListener</code> is a listener interface that may be
 * implemented by an application developer.
 * <p>
 * An <code>ApplicationServiceListener</code> object is registered with the Framework
 * using the <code>ApplicationContext.addServiceListener</code> method.
 * <code>ApplicationServiceListener</code> objects are called with an
 * <code>ApplicationServiceEvent</code> object when a service is registered, modified, or
 * is in the process of unregistering.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>ApplicationServiceEvent</code> object delivery to 
 * <code>ApplicationServiceListener</code>
 * objects is filtered by the filter specified when the listener was registered.
 * If the Java Runtime Environment supports permissions, then additional
 * filtering is done. <code>ApplicationServiceEvent</code> objects are only delivered to
 * the listener if the application which defines the listener object's class has the
 * appropriate <code>ServicePermission</code> to get the service using at
 * least one of the named classes the service was registered under, and the application
 * specified its dependence on the corresponding service in the application metadata.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>ApplicationServiceEvent</code> object delivery to <code>ApplicationServiceListener</code>
 * objects is further filtered according to package sources as defined in
 * {@link ServiceReference#isAssignableTo(Bundle, String)}.
