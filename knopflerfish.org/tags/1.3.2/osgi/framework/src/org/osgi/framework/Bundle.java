/**
 * An installed bundle in the Framework.
 *
 * <p>A <tt>Bundle</tt> object is the access point to define the life cycle
 * of an installed bundle. Each bundle installed in the OSGi environment
 * will have an associated <tt>Bundle</tt> object.
 *
 * <p>A bundle will have a unique identity, a <tt>long</tt>, chosen by the
 * Framework. This identity will not change during the life cycle of a bundle, even when
 * the bundle is updated. Uninstalling and then reinstalling the bundle will create
 * a new unique identity.
 *
 * <p>A bundle can be in one of six states:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #UNINSTALLED}
 * <li>{@link #INSTALLED}
 * <li>{@link #RESOLVED}
 * <li>{@link #STARTING}
 * <li>{@link #STOPPING}
 * <li>{@link #ACTIVE}
 * </ul>
 * <p>Values assigned to these states have no specified ordering;
 * they represent bit values that may be ORed together to determine if
 * a bundle is in one of the valid states.
 *
 * <p>A bundle should only execute code when its state is one of
 * <tt>STARTING</tt>, <tt>ACTIVE</tt>, or <tt>STOPPING</tt>.
 * An <tt>UNINSTALLED</tt> bundle can not be set to another state; it
 * is a zombie and can only be reached because invalid references are kept somewhere.
 *
 * <p>The Framework is the only entity that is allowed to
 * create <tt>Bundle</tt> objects, and these objects are only valid
 * within the Framework that created them.
