/**
 * The Permission Admin service allows management agents to
 * manage the permissions of bundles. There is at most one Permission Admin
 * service present in the OSGi environment.
 * <p>
 * Access to the Permission Admin service is protected by
 * corresponding
 * <tt>ServicePermission</tt>. In addition <tt>AdminPermission</tt>
 * is required to actually set permissions.
 *
 * <p>Bundle permissions are managed using a permission table. A bundle's location
 * serves as the key into this permission table. The value of a table entry is
 * the set of permissions (of type <tt>PermissionInfo</tt>) granted to the
 * bundle named by the given location.
 * A bundle may have an entry in the permission table prior to being installed
 * in the Framework.
 *
 * <p>The permissions specified in <tt>setDefaultPermissions</tt> are used as the
 * default
 * permissions which are granted to all bundles that do not have an entry in
 * the permission table.
 *
 * <p>Any changes to a bundle's permissions in the permission table will take
 * effect no later than when bundle's <tt>java.security.ProtectionDomain</tt>
 * is next involved in a permission check, and will be made persistent.
 *
 * <p>Only permission classes on the system classpath or from an exported
 * package are considered during a permission check.
 * Additionally, only permission classes that are subclasses of
 * <tt>java.security.Permission</tt> and define a 2-argument constructor
 * that takes a <i>name</i> string and an <i>actions</i> string can be used.
 * <p>
 * Permissions implicitly granted by the Framework (for example, a bundle's
 * permission to access its persistent storage area) cannot be changed, and
 * are not reflected in the permissions returned by <tt>getPermissions</tt>
 * and <tt>getDefaultPermissions</tt>.
