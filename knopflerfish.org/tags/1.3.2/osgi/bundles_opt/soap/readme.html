<h2>The Knopflerfish Axis port</h2>

<p>
The Knopflerfish Axis port provides SOAP/Web service access to any OSGi 
bundle, both for exporting OSGi services as Web Services and for importing 
web services into an OSGI framework.

<h3><a href="axis-osgi">axis-osgi</a></h3>

<p>
This is an OSGi bundlification of a standard Axis server. The standard Axis
server is designed to be running in a servlet version 2.3 environment, while
the OSGi HTTP service is based on a servlet 2.1 environment. It should be noted
that no modifications have been made to any of the Axis classes, so all code
specific to the OSGi port is made as pure "extensions". In addition to the
bundlification of the Axis server the axis-osgi bundle offers the ability to
export services, registered on the OSGi framework service registry, as SOAP
services. It should be noted that for this to work the exported objects must
not expose any data types not supported by SOAP. In order to export a service 
object as a SOAP service, the only thing needed is to set a property named
"SOAP_SERVICE_NAME" on the registered service. The property value should be
of type java.lang.String and its value will be used as the name of the
exposed SOAP service.
</p>

<p>
The inital SOAP configuration of the Axis server is given by the file
"/axis/server-config.wsdd". In case you want to add some services or for
some other reason modify the initial configuration, this is where to do
it.
</p>
<p>
The code to make all this work consist of just a few quite small classes (not
counting all Axis classes) so it is quite easy to get an overview of the
porting effort. However it took some time experimenting and studying the Axis
code to make this work, so some of the code may be harder to understand.

</p>
<p>
Note that the axis-osgi bundle depends on the commons-logging bundle to
be installed an started. Further if your JRE does not support an XML parser
you need to provide that as well (e.g Xerces).


</p>
<p>
The axis-osgi.jar file is quite large, due to the contained axis.jar (and
other contained jars). Some of the Axis classes may be left out, e.g. client
related classes, in case you will not run any Axis clients on your OSGi
framework, WSDL related classes in case you give up the ability for the server
to generate WSDL for the SOAP services. These kind of optimizations have not
been performed, but is probably possible to perform in case it becomes critical
to reduce the required memory footprint.
</p>

<h3><a href="soapobject">soapobject</a></h3>

<p>
This is an example of a server side SOAP object.
</p>
<p>


The soapobject bundle installs a service object into the service registry and
sets its SOAP_SERVICE_NAME property to "remoteFW". This will make the axis-osgi
bundle (must be run prior to start of the soapobject bundle) create an Axis 
SOAP service named "remoteFW". Use the following URLs from a Web browser to 
explore the service.
</p>
<pre>
   http://localhost:8080/axis/services

   http://localhost:8080/axis/services?list

   http://localhost:8080/axis/services/remoteFW?method=getBundles

   http://localhost:8080/axis/services/remoteFW?wsdl
</pre>

<p>
Beware of caching made by the browser, ensure that you are not viewing 
cached content by performing explicit refresh requests.
</p>


<h3><a href="soapclient">soapclient</a></h3>

<p>
This is an example of a client side program. The client calls the "remoteFW" 
service methods, so you need to have the soapobject bundle insatlled and 
started. The build.xml performs all required steps for the creation and 
and execution of the client program. The only handcoded module is the 
Test.java (main class of the client program). The build file will 
automatically fetch the WSDL from the running OSGi framework, generate 
the client side stubs and support classes, compile the generated classes 
as well as Test.java.
</p>
<p>

When all have been built (compiled) the client program is executed and 
the results are displayed.
</p>


<h3><a href="soap_desktop">soap_desktop</a></h3>
<p>
This is a SOAP service browser written as a plugin for the Swing Desktop.
When started, it adds a view that displays all available services
on a named SOAP host. The services can be browsed for operations and
the operations can be invoked. The SOAP host can be changed to view
services on another host.
</p>

<p>
The default SOAP host is "http://localhost:<web server port>"
</p>

<p>
The implementation has only been tested with services generated
by exporting OSGi service via Axis, and is not complete in terms of
all possible data types. The primitive types and arrays, are however 
supported, both as input arguments and as results.
