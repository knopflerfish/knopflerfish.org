<h1>SOAP Client</h1>

<div class="abstract">
This is an example of a Java client using a SOAP object.
</div>

<p> The program is part of the <a href="../soap/index.html#axis1">The
Knopflerfish Axis 1</a> package.  </p>


<h2>Description</h2>

<p> <tt>soapclient</tt> is an example of a client side program. The
client calls the "remoteFW" service methods, so you need to have the
soapobject bundle installed and started. The <tt>build.xml</tt>
performs all required steps for the creation and and execution of the
client program. The only hand coded module is the <tt>Test.java</tt>
(main class of the client program). The build file will automatically
fetch the WSDL from the running OSGi framework, generate the client
side stubs and support classes, compile the generated classes as well
as <tt>Test.java</tt>.  </p>

<p> When all have been built (compiled) the client program is executed
and the results are displayed.  </p>
