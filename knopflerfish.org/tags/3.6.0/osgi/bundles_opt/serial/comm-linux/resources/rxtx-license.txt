A program that contains no derivative of any portion of RXTX, but is 
designed to work with RXTX by being compiled or linked with it, is 
considered a "work that uses the Library" subject to the terms and 
conditions of the GNU Lesser General Public License. 



As a special exception, the copyright holders of RXTX give you permission
to link RXTX with independent modules that communicate with RXTX solely
through the Sun Microsytems CommAPI interface, regardless of the license
terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting
combined work under terms of your choice, provided that every copy of the
combined work is accompanied by a complete copy of the source code of RXTX
(the version of RXTX used to produce the combined work), being distributed

An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on RXTX. 



Note that people who make modified versions of RXTX are not obligated to
grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is their choice
whether to do so. The GNU Lesser General Public License gives permission to
release a modified version without this exception; this exception also makes
it possible to release a modified version which carries forward this exception.
