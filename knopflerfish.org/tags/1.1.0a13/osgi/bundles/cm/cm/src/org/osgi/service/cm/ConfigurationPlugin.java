/**
 * A service interface for processing configuration dictionary before the update.
 *
 * <p>A bundle registers a <tt>ConfigurationPlugin</tt> object in order to process
 * configuration updates before they reach the Managed Service or Managed Service Factory.
 * The Configuration Admin service will detect registrations
 * of Configuration Plugin services and must call these services every
 * time  before it calls the <tt>ManagedService</tt> or <tt>ManagedServiceFactory</tt>
 * <tt>updated</tt> method.  The
 * Configuration Plugin service thus has the opportunity to view and modify
 * the properties before they are passed to the ManagedS ervice or
 * Managed Service Factory.
 *
 * <p>Configuration Plugin (plugin) services have full read/write access to all
 * configuration information. Therefore, bundles using this facility should
 * be trusted. Access to this facility should be limited with <tt>ServicePermission[REGISTER, ConfigurationPlugin]</tt>.
 * Implementations of a Configuration Plugin service should assure that they
 * only act on appropriate configurations.
 *
 * <p>The <tt>Integer</tt> <tt>service.cmRanking</tt> registration
 * property may be specified.  Not specifying this registration
 * property, or setting it to something other than an <tt>Integer</tt>, is the
 * same as setting it to the <tt>Integer</tt> zero.  The
 * <tt>service.cmRanking</tt> property determines the order in which
 * plugins are invoked.  Lower ranked plugins are called before
 * higher ranked ones.  In the event of more than one plugin having
 * the same value of <tt>service.cmRanking</tt>, then the
 * Configuration Admin service arbitrarily chooses the order in which they are
 * called.
 *
 * <p>By convention, plugins with <tt>service.cmRanking&lt; 0</tt>
 * or <tt>service.cmRanking &gt; 1000</tt> should not make
 * modifications to the properties.
 *
 * <p>The Configuration Admin service has the right to hide properties from
 * plugins, or to ignore some or all the changes that they make. This
 * might be done for security reasons.  Any such behavior is entirely
 * implementation defined.
 *
 * <p>A plugin may optionally specify a <tt>cm.target</tt> registration
 * property whose value is the PID of the Managed Service or
 * Managed Service Factory whose configuration updates the plugin
 * is intended to intercept.  The plugin will then only be called
 * with configuration updates that are targetted at the
 * Managed Service or Managed Service Factory with the specified
 * PID.  Omitting the <tt>cm.target</tt> registration property means
 * that the plugin is called for all configuration updates.
