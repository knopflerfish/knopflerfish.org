/**
 * Service for administering configuration data.
 *
 * <p>The main purpose of this interface is to store bundle configuration
 * data persistently. This information is
 * represented in <tt>Configuration</tt> objects. The actual configuration
 * data is a <tt>Dictionary</tt> of properties inside a <tt>Configuration</tt>
 * object.
 *
 * <p>There are two principally different ways to manage
 * configurations. First there is the concept of a Managed Service,
 * where configuration data is uniquely associated with an object
 * registered with the service registry.
 *
 * <p>Next, there is the concept of a factory where the Configuration Admin
 * service will maintain 0 or more <tt>Configuration</tt> objects for a
 * Managed Service Factory that is registered with the Framework.
 *
 * <p>The first concept is intended for configuration data
 * about "things/services" whose existence is defined
 * externally, e.g. a specific printer. Factories are
 * intended for "things/services" that can be created any number of
 * times, e.g. a configuration for a DHCP server for different
 * networks.
 *
 * <p>Bundles that require configuration should register a
 * Managed Service or a Managed Service Factory in the service
 * registry. A registration property named <tt>service.pid</tt> (persistent
 * identifier or PID) must be used to identify this Managed Service or
 * Managed Service Factory to the Configuration Admin service.
 *
 * <p>When the ConfigurationAdmin detects the registration of a
 * Managed Service, it checks its persistent storage for a configuration
 * object whose PID matches the PID registration property (<tt>service.pid</tt>) of the
 * Managed Service. If found, it calls {@link ManagedService#updated} method
 * with the new properties. The implementation of a Configuration Admin service
 * must run these call-backs asynchronously to allow proper synchronization.
 *
 * <p>When the Configuration Admin service detects a Managed Service Factory
 * registration, it checks its storage for configuration objects whose
 * <tt>factoryPid</tt> matches the PID of the
 * Managed Service Factory.  For each such <tt>Configuration</tt> objects, it
 * calls the <tt>ManagedServiceFactory.updated</tt> method asynchronously
 * with the new properties. The calls to the <tt>updated</tt> method
 * of a <tt>ManagedServiceFactory</tt> must be executed sequentially and not
 * overlap in time.
 *
 * <p>In general, bundles having permission to use the
 * Configuration Admin service can only access and modify their own
 * configuration information.  Accessing or modifying the
 * configuration of another bundle requires <tt>AdminPermission</tt>.
 *
 * <p><tt>Configuration</tt> objects can be <i>bound</i> to a specified bundle
 * location. In this case, if a matching Managed Service or
 * Managed Service Factory is registered by a bundle with a different
 * location, then the Configuration Admin service must not do the normal
 * callback, and it should log an error. In the case where a
 * <tt>Configuration</tt> object is not bound, its location field is <tt>null</tt>, the
 * Configuration Admin service will bind it to the location of the bundle that
 * registers the first Managed Service or Managed Service Factory that
 * has a corresponding PID property.
 * When a <tt>Configuration</tt> object is bound to a bundle location in this
 * manner, the Confguration Admin service must detect if the bundle corresponding
 * to the location is uninstalled. If this occurs, the <tt>Configuration</tt>
 * object is unbound, that is its location field is set back to <tt>null</tt>.
 *
 * <p>The method descriptions of this class refer to a concept of
 * "the calling bundle".  This is a loose way of referring to the
 * bundle which obtained the Configuration Admin service from the
 * service registry. Implementations of <tt>ConfigurationAdmin</tt>
 * must use a {@link org.osgi.framework.ServiceFactory} to support this concept.
