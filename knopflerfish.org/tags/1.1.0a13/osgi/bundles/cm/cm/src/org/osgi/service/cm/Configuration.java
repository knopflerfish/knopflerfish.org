/**
 * The configuration information for a <tt>ManagedService</tt> or <tt>ManagedServiceFactory</tt> object.
 *
 * The Configuration Admin service uses this interface to represent the
 * configuration information for a <tt>ManagedService</tt> or for a service instance
 * of a <tt>ManagedServiceFactory</tt>.
 *
 * <p>A <tt>Configuration</tt> object contains a configuration dictionary and
 * allows the properties to be updated via this object. Bundles wishing
 * to receive configuration dictionaries do not need to use this class
 * - they register a <tt>ManagedService</tt> or <tt>ManagedServiceFactory</tt>.
 * Only administrative bundles, and bundles
 * wishing to update their own configurations need to use this class.
 *
 * <p>The properties handled in this configuration have case
 * insensitive <tt>String</tt> objects as keys. However, case is preserved from the last set
 * key/value. The value of the property may be of the following
 * types:
 *
 * <pre>
 * type        ::=
 *    String     | Integer    | Long
 *  | Float      | Double     | Byte
 *  | Short      | Character  | Boolean
 *  | vector     | arrays
 * primitive   ::= long | int | short | char | byte | double | float
 * arrays      ::= primitive '[]' | type '[]' | null
 * vector      ::= Vector of type or null
 * </pre>
 * <p>This explicitly allows vectors and arrays of mixed types and containing <tt>null</tt>.
 * <p>A configuration can be <i>bound</i> to a bundle location
 * (<tt>Bundle.getLocation()</tt>). The purpose of binding a <tt>Configuration</tt> object
 * to a location is to make it impossible for another bundle to
 * forge a PID that would match this configuration. When a
 * configuration is bound to a specific location, and a bundle with a
 * different location registers a corresponding <tt>ManagedService</tt> object or
 * <tt>ManagedServiceFactory</tt> object, then the configuration is not passed to the
 * updated method of that object.
 *
 * <p>If a configuration's location is <tt>null</tt>, it is not yet bound to a
 * location. It will become bound to the location of the first bundle that registers a
 * <tt>ManagedService</tt> or <tt>ManagedServiceFactory</tt> object with the corresponding PID.
 * <p>The same <tt>Configuration</tt> object is used for configuring
 * both a Managed Service Factory and a Managed Service. When it is important
 * to differentiate between these two the term "factory configuration" is used.
 *
 * @version $Revision: 1.1.1.1 $
