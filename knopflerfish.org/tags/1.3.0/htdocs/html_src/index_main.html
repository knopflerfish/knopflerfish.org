<h3>The Knopflerfish project</h3>
The Knopflerfish project is based on the Gatespace GDSP OSGi framework,
which has been in development since 1999. Several of the core developers from Gatespace are active in the Knopflerfish project.
<p>
Gatespace was one of the original members of OSGi and now develops both OSGi application software, as well as <a href="http://www.gatespacetelematics.com">telematics</a> and <a href="http://www.gatespace.com">broadband</a> applications.

The Knopflerfish project's goal is to develop and distribute
easy to use open source code, build tools and applications, related to
the OSGi framework. See <a href="charter_se.html">charter</a> for details. (currently only in Swedish).

<h3>The OSGi framework</h3>
OSGi, Open Service Gateway Initiative,
specifies an industry standard Java application platform,
allowing multiple applications, to securely run in a
single JVM. These programs can share resources as data, functionality
and threads.

<p>
Applications areas for OSGi ranges from use as a service platform on
embedded devices, to plugin mechanisms for larger programs.
The initial goal of OSGi was the embedded market, but other uses
are certainly possible.
