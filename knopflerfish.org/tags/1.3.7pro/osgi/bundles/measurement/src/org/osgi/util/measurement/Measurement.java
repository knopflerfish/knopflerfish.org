/**
 * Represents a value with an error, a unit and a time-stamp.
 *
 * <p>A <tt>Measurement</tt> object is used for maintaining the tuple
 * of value, error, unit and time-stamp.
 * The value and error are represented as doubles
 * and the time is measured in milliseconds since midnight,
 * January 1, 1970 UTC.
 *
 * <p>Mathematic methods are provided that correctly calculate
 * taking the error into account. A runtime error
 * will occur when two measurements are
 * used in an incompatible way. E.g., when a speed
 * (m/s) is added to a distance (m). The measurement
 * class will correctly track changes in unit during
 * multiplication and division, always coercing the
 * result to the most simple form.	
 * See {@link Unit} for more information on the
 * supported units.
 *
 * <p>Errors in the measurement class are absolute errors.
 * Measurement errors should use the P95 rule. Actual values
 * must fall in the range value +/- error 95% or more of the time.
 *
 * <p>A <tt>Measurement</tt> object is immutable in order to be
 * easily shared.
 *
 * <p>Note: This class has a natural ordering that is
 * inconsistent with equals. See {@link #compareTo}.
