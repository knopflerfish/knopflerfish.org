/**
 * Data Producer, a service that can generate values to be used by {@link Consumer} services.
 *
 * <p>Service objects registered under the Producer interface are expected to produce
 * values (internally generated or from external sensors). The value can be of different
 * types. When delivering a value to a <tt>Wire</tt> object,
 * the Producer service should coerce the value to be an instance of one of the types
 * specified by {@link Wire#getFlavors}. The classes are specified in order
 * of preference.
 *
 * <p>When the data represented by the Producer object changes,
 * this object should send the
 * updated value by calling the <tt>update</tt> method on each of <tt>Wire</tt> objects
 * passed in the most recent call to this object's {@link #consumersConnected} method.
 * These <tt>Wire</tt> objects will pass the value on to the associated <tt>Consumer</tt> service object.
 *
 * <p>The Producer service may use the information in the <tt>Wire</tt> object's properties to
 * schedule the delivery of values to the <tt>Wire</tt> object.
 *
 * <p>Producer service objects must register with a <tt>service.pid</tt>
 * and a {@link WireConstants#WIREADMIN_PRODUCER_FLAVORS} property.
 * It is recommended that a Producer service object also registers with a
 * <tt>service.description</tt> property.
 * Producer service objects must register with a
 * {@link WireConstants#WIREADMIN_PRODUCER_FILTERS} property if the Producer
 * service will be performing filtering instead of the <tt>Wire</tt> object.
 *
 * <p>If an exception is thrown by a Producer object method,
 * a <tt>WireAdminEvent</tt> of type {@link WireAdminEvent#PRODUCER_EXCEPTION} is
 * broadcast by the Wire Admin service.
 *
 * <p>Security Considerations. Data producing bundles will require <tt>ServicePermission[REGISTER,Producer]</tt> to
 * register a Producer service. In general, only the Wire Admin service
 * should have <tt>ServicePermission[GET,Producer]</tt>. Thus only
 * the Wire Admin service may directly call a Producer service.
 * Care must be taken in the sharing of <tt>Wire</tt> objects with other bundles.
 * <p>
 * Producer services must be registered with scope names when they can send different types of
 * objects (composite) to the Consumer service. The Producer service should have <tt>WirePermission</tt> for
 * each of these scope names.
