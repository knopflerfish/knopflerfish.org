/**
 * The base interface for <tt>Role</tt> objects managed by the User Admin
 * service.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface exposes the characteristics shared by all <tt>Role</tt>
 * classes: a name, a type, and a set of properties.
 * <p>
 * Properties represent public information about the <tt>Role</tt> object that
 * can be read by anyone. Specific {@link UserAdminPermission}objects are
 * required to change a <tt>Role</tt> object's properties.
 * <p>
 * <tt>Role</tt> object properties are <tt>Dictionary</tt> objects. Changes
 * to these objects are propagated to the User Admin service and made
 * persistent.
 * <p>
 * Every User Admin service contains a set of predefined <tt>Role</tt> objects
 * that are always present and cannot be removed. All predefined <tt>Role</tt>
 * objects are of type <tt>ROLE</tt>. This version of the
 * <tt>org.osgi.service.useradmin</tt> package defines a single predefined
 * role named &quot;user.anyone&quot;, which is inherited by any other role.
 * Other predefined roles may be added in the future. Since
 * &quot;user.anyone&quot; is a <tt>Role</tt> object that has properties
 * associated with it that can be read and modified. Access to these properties
 * and their use is application specific and is controlled using
 * <tt>UserAdminPermission</tt> in the same way that properties for other
 * <tt>Role</tt> objects are.
