/**
 * Condition to test if the signer of a bundle matches a pattern. Since the bundle's signer can
 * only change when the bundle is updated, this condition is immutable.
 * <p>
 * The condition expressed using a single String that specifies a Distinguished
 * Name (DN) chain to match bundle signers against. DN's are encoded using IETF
 * RFC 2253. Usually signers use certificates that are issued by certificate
 * authorities, which also have a corresponding DN and certificate. The
 * certificate authorities can form a chain of trust where the last DN and
 * certificate is known by the framework. The signer of a bundle is expressed as
 * signers DN followed by the DN of its issuer followed by the DN of the next
 * issuer until the DN of the root certificate authority. Each DN is separated
 * by a semicolon.
 * <p>
 * A bundle can satisfy this condition if one of its signers has a DN chain that
 * matches the DN chain used to construct this condition. Wildcards (`*') can be
 * used to allow greater flexibility in specifying the DN chains. Wildcards can
 * be used in place of DNs, RDNs, or the value in an RDN. If a wildcard is used
 * for a value of an RDN, the value must be exactly "*" and will match any value
 * for the corresponding type in that RDN. If a wildcard is used for a RDN, it
 * must be the first RDN and will match any number of RDNs (including zero
 * RDNs).
