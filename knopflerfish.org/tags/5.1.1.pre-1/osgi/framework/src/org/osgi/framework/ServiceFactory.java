/**
 * Allows services to provide customized service objects in the OSGi
 * environment.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When registering a service, a {@code ServiceFactory} object can be used
 * instead of a service object, so that the bundle developer can gain control of
 * the specific service object granted to a bundle that is using the service.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When this happens, the {@code BundleContext.getService(ServiceReference)}
 * method calls the {@code ServiceFactory.getService} method to create a service
 * object specifically for the requesting bundle. The service object returned by
 * the {@code ServiceFactory} is cached by the Framework until the bundle
 * releases its use of the service.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When the bundle's use count for the service is decremented to zero (including
 * the bundle stopping or the service being unregistered), the
 * {@code ServiceFactory.ungetService} method is called.
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@code ServiceFactory} objects are only used by the Framework and are not
 * made available to other bundles in the OSGi environment. The Framework may
 * concurrently call a {@code ServiceFactory}.

	 * factory can then return a specific service object for each bundle.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The Framework must check that the returned service object is valid. If
	 * the returned service object is {@code null} or is not an
