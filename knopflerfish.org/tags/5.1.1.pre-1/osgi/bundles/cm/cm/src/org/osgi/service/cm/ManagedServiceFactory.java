/**
 * Manage multiple service instances.
 * 
 * Bundles registering this interface are giving the Configuration Admin service
 * the ability to create and configure a number of instances of a service that
 * the implementing bundle can provide. For example, a bundle implementing a
 * DHCP server could be instantiated multiple times for different interfaces
 * using a factory.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each of these <i>service instances </i> is represented, in the persistent
 * storage of the Configuration Admin service, by a factory
 * {@code Configuration} object that has a PID. When such a
 * {@code Configuration} is updated, the Configuration Admin service calls the
 * {@code ManagedServiceFactory} updated method with the new properties. When
 * {@code updated} is called with a new PID, the Managed Service Factory should
 * create a new factory instance based on these configuration properties. When
 * called with a PID that it has seen before, it should update that existing
 * service instance with the new configuration information.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In general it is expected that the implementation of this interface will
 * maintain a data structure that maps PIDs to the factory instances that it has
 * created. The semantics of a factory instance are defined by the Managed
 * Service Factory. However, if the factory instance is registered as a service
 * object with the service registry, its PID should match the PID of the
 * corresponding {@code Configuration} object (but it should <b>not </b> be
 * registered as a Managed Service!).
 * 
 * <p>
 * An example that demonstrates the use of a factory. It will create serial
 * ports under command of the Configuration Admin service.

 *         ManagedServiceFactory.class.getName(),

 *       if ( port == null ) {
 *         port = new SerialPortService();
 *         ports.put( pid, port );
