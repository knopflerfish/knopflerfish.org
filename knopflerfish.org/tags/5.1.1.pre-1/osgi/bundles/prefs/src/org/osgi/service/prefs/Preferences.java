/**
 * A node in a hierarchical collection of preference data.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface allows applications to store and retrieve user and system
 * preference data. This data is stored persistently in an
 * implementation-dependent backing store. Typical implementations include flat
 * files, OS-specific registries, directory servers and SQL databases.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For each bundle, there is a separate tree of nodes for each user, and one for
 * system preferences. The precise description of "user" and "system" will vary
 * from one bundle to another. Typical information stored in the user preference
 * tree might include font choice, and color choice for a bundle which interacts
 * with the user via a servlet. Typical information stored in the system
 * preference tree might include installation data, or things like high score
 * information for a game program.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Nodes in a preference tree are named in a similar fashion to directories in a
 * hierarchical file system. Every node in a preference tree has a <i>node name
 * </i> (which is not necessarily unique), a unique <i>absolute path name </i>,
 * and a path name <i>relative </i> to each ancestor including itself.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The root node has a node name of the empty {@code String} object (""). Every
 * other node has an arbitrary node name, specified at the time it is created.
 * The only restrictions on this name are that it cannot be the empty string,
 * and it cannot contain the slash character ('/').
 * 
 * <p>
 * The root node has an absolute path name of {@code "/"}. Children of the root
 * node have absolute path names of {@code "/" + } <i>&lt;node name&gt; </i>.
 * All other nodes have absolute path names of <i>&lt;parent's absolute path
 * name&gt; </i> {@code  + "/" + } <i>&lt;node name&gt; </i>. Note that all
 * absolute path names begin with the slash character.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A node <i>n </i>'s path name relative to its ancestor <i>a </i> is simply the
 * string that must be appended to <i>a </i>'s absolute path name in order to
 * form <i>n </i>'s absolute path name, with the initial slash character (if
 * present) removed. Note that:
 * <ul>
 * <li>No relative path names begin with the slash character.</li>
 * <li>Every node's path name relative to itself is the empty string.</li>
 * <li>Every node's path name relative to its parent is its node name (except
 * for the root node, which does not have a parent).</li>
 * <li>Every node's path name relative to the root is its absolute path name
 * with the initial slash character removed.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note finally that:
 * <ul>
 * <li>No path name contains multiple consecutive slash characters.</li>
 * <li>No path name with the exception of the root's absolute path name end in
 * the slash character.</li>
 * <li>Any string that conforms to these two rules is a valid path name.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each {@code Preference} node has zero or more properties associated with it,
 * where a property consists of a name and a value. The bundle writer is free to
 * choose any appropriate names for properties. Their values can be of type
 * {@code String},{@code long},{@code int},{@code boolean}, {@code byte[]},
 * {@code float}, or {@code double} but they can always be accessed as if they
 * were {@code String} objects.
 * 
 * <p>
 * All node name and property name comparisons are case-sensitive.
 * 
 * <p>
 * All of the methods that modify preference data are permitted to operate
 * asynchronously; they may return immediately, and changes will eventually
 * propagate to the persistent backing store, with an implementation-dependent
 * delay. The {@code flush} method may be used to synchronously force updates to
 * the backing store.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Implementations must automatically attempt to flush to the backing store any
 * pending updates for a bundle's preferences when the bundle is stopped or
 * otherwise ungets the Preferences Service.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The methods in this class may be invoked concurrently by multiple threads in
 * a single Java Virtual Machine (JVM) without the need for external
 * synchronization, and the results will be equivalent to some serial execution.
 * If this class is used concurrently <i>by multiple JVMs </i> that store their
 * preference data in the same backing store, the data store will not be
 * corrupted, but no other guarantees are made concerning the consistency of the
 * preference data.
