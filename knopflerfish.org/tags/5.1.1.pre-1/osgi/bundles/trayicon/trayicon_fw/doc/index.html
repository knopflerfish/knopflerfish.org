<div class="abstract">
  A simple trayicon supporting start level change and framework shutdown.
</div>


<h2>Description</h2>

This bundle adds an icon representing the framework to the system tray
for a desktop. See the Java-doc for java.awt.SystemTray for the
definition of what the system tray is on different window systems.
The standard <tt>java.awt.SystemTray</tt> and
<tt>java.awt.TrayIcon</tt> classes was added in Java™&nbsp;6 thus this
bundle will only be fully functional on Java™&nbsp;6 and later.

<p>

The Tray Icon offers two operations:
<ul>

  <li>Change start level.

  <li>Stop the framework.

</ul>
