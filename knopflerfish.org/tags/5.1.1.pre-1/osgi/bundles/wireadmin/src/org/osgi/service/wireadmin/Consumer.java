/**
 * Data Consumer, a service that can receive udpated values from
 * {@link Producer} services.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Service objects registered under the {@code Consumer} interface are expected
 * to consume values from a Producer service via a {@code Wire} object. A
 * Consumer service may poll the Producer service by calling the
 * {@link Wire#poll()} method. The Consumer service will also receive an updated
 * value when called at it's {@link #updated(Wire, Object)} method. The Producer
 * service should have coerced the value to be an instance of one of the types
 * specified by the {@link Wire#getFlavors()} method, or one of their
 * subclasses.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Consumer service objects must register with a {@code service.pid} and a
 * {@link WireConstants#WIREADMIN_CONSUMER_FLAVORS} property. It is recommended
 * that Consumer service objects also register with a
 * {@code service.description} property.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If an {@code Exception} is thrown by any of the {@code Consumer} methods, a
 * {@code WireAdminEvent} of type {@link WireAdminEvent#CONSUMER_EXCEPTION} is
 * broadcast by the Wire Admin service.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Security Considerations - Data consuming bundles will require
 * {@code ServicePermission[Consumer,REGISTER]}. In general, only the Wire Admin
 * service bundle should have this permission. Thus only the Wire Admin service
 * may directly call a Consumer service. Care must be taken in the sharing of
 * {@code Wire} objects with other bundles.
 * <p>
 * Consumer services must be registered with their scope when they can receive
 * different types of objects from the Producer service. The Consumer service
 * should have {@code WirePermission} for each of these scope names.
