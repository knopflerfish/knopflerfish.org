/**

 * A HostedCapability is a Capability where the {@link #getResource()} method
 * returns a Resource that hosts this Capability instead of declaring it. This
 * is necessary for cases where the declaring Resource of a Capability does not
 * match the runtime state. For example, this is the case for fragments attached
 * to a host. Most fragment declared capabilities and requirements become hosted
 * by the host resource. Since a fragment can attach to multiple hosts, a single
 * capability can actually be hosted multiple times.
