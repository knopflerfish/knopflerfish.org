 * <p><tt>BundleActivator</tt> is an interface that may be implemented
 * when this bundle is started or stopped. The Framework can create instances of this bundle's
 * <tt>BundleActivator</tt> as required. If an instance's <tt>BundleActivator.start</tt>
 * method executes successfully, it is guaranteed that the same instance's <tt>BundleActivator.stop</tt>
 * method will be called when this bundle is to be stopped.
 *
 * <p><tt>BundleActivator</tt> is specified through the
 * <tt>Bundle-Activator</tt> Manifest header. A bundle can only specify
 * a single <tt>BundleActivator</tt> in the Manifest file.
 * The form of the Manifest header is:
 * <pre>
 * Bundle-Activator: <i>class-name</i>
 * </pre>
 * where <code>class-name</code> is a fully qualified Java classname.
 * <p>The specified <tt>BundleActivator</tt> class must have a public constructor
 * that takes no parameters so that a <tt>BundleActivator</tt> object can
 * be created by <tt>Class.newInstance()</tt>.
