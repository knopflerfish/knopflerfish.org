2004-03-22: 
 build       bundlebuild_include.xml now uses the bundle.name property

 startup     Included support for tray icons, when running on window
             platforms. See docs for org.knopflerfish.service.trayicon

 repo:       Repository moved to Subversion:

               https://www.knopflerfish.org/svn/

          

2004-03-20:  Added target install, start, stop, update and uninstall
             to bundlebuild_include.xml. These targets communicates
             to a running framework using the telnet console.

             Note: requires netcomponents.jar in $ANT_HOME/lib

2004-03-17:  HTTP bug/oddity fix. 
             HTTP 1.0 and POST and Connection="close" hanged
             the input stream. This is now fixed

             Desktop tested to work on Eclipse OSGi FW!

             > eclipse -console 9191

             > telnet localhost 9191

              osgi > install file:util-1.0.0.jar
              osgi > install file:desktop_all-1.1.0.jar
              osgi > start <desktop bid>

             ...and off you go!

2004-03-17:  Startlevel now truly persistent

             Changed ServiceTracker to comply with ref code
             and catch IllegalStateException in close()

             Changed specification-version on useradmin,
             http and cm to 3-digit.

2004-03-16:  Added grabbing of system out/err to the log service

¨               -Dorg.knopflerfish.log.grabio=true

             System.out.println is logged as INFO on the system bundle.
             System.err.println is logged as ERROR on the system bundle.

             IO grabbing is only active when the log is NOT printing
             directly to stdout to avoid recursive effects. 
     

2004-03-10:  Default http port changed internally to 80.
             Startup xargs still uses 8080
