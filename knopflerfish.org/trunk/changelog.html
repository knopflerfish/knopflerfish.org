 fw:         Fixed BundleClassLoader.getResources() bug that
             didn't returned all available resources when multiple

             Disabled the publicly available bundle: URL syntax.
             This can be enabled/disabled using the
               org.knopflerfish.osgi.registerbundleurlhandler
             system property.

             Made OSGi URL service handler possible to disable
             using system properrty

2004-07-14

             Fixed bugs in consoletty (ugly stop when console service

             doesn't result in half-functional registered HttpService.
             
             This means that socket binding failures results in
             no registered HttpService instead of an HttpService
             with no port number property set.

2004-04-13:
             Added start level commands to frameworkcommands bundle

             Deskop able to remotely control other frameworks using 
             SOAP.

             Modified ant build scripts to filter out empty manifest 
             values. This is useful for handling optional attribs like
             Bundle-NativeCode.

2004-04-04:

2004-03-22:

2004-03-20:  Added target install, start, stop, update and uninstall
             to bundlebuild_include.xml. These targets communicates
             to a running framework using the telnet console.

             Note: requires netcomponents.jar in $ANT_HOME/lib

2004-03-17:  HTTP bug/oddity fix. 
             HTTP 1.0 and POST and Connection="close" hanged
             the input stream. This is now fixed

             Desktop tested to work on Eclipse OSGi FW!

             > eclipse -console 9191

             > telnet localhost 9191

              osgi > install file:util-1.0.0.jar
              osgi > install file:desktop_all-1.1.0.jar
              osgi > start <desktop bid>

             ...and off you go!

2004-03-17:  Startlevel now truly persistent

             Changed ServiceTracker to comply with ref code
             and catch IllegalStateException in close()

             Changed specification-version on useradmin,
             http and cm to 3-digit.

2004-03-16:  Added grabbing of system out/err to the log service

¨               -Dorg.knopflerfish.log.grabio=true

             System.out.println is logged as INFO on the system bundle.
             System.err.println is logged as ERROR on the system bundle.

             IO grabbing is only active when the log is NOT printing
             directly to stdout to avoid recursive effects. 
     

2004-03-10:  Default http port changed internally to 80.
             Startup xargs still uses 8080
