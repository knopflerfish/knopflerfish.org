ChangeLog for Knopflerfish 2
============================

All changes apply to "trunk", if not otherwise stated. Builds from
trunk are available each night at

   http://www.knopflerfish.org/snapshots/trunk/

2006-09-13:
 useradmin:  Added persistence. The path to the file where user admin data is
             stored can be set with the system property
              org.knopflerfish.useradmin.store
             If this is not set, the bundle's data storage area is used,
             meaning that starting the platform with -init purges the data.
             One can also use the system property
              org.knopflerfish.useradmin.oldstore
             to define a path that is used to read the data if the
             org.knopflerfish.useradmin.store property is set to a path that
             does not exist yet. This can be used to move the store to a new
             location.

2006-09-12:
 component:  Fixed a bug where, under certain circumstances, null was passed
             to bind/unbind methods.
