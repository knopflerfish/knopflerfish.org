<h2>How the test was performed</h2>

The test was performed by 
 <ol>
  <li>Launching the framework from a wrapper script. See <a href="https://www.knopflerfish.org/svn/knopflerfish.org/trunk/osgi/bundles_opt/timing_tester/">timing_tester</a> bundle for source.
  <li>Installing and starting a set of "typical bundles". See <a href="#bundles">bundle list</a> for exact bundles.
  <li>Installing a special notification bundle.
  <li>Measuring the time until the notification bundle was started
  <li>Repeat from 1-4 multiple times.
</ol>

The test was performed on
<pre>
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_03-b02)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2_03-b02, mixed mode)
</pre>
The machine used for testing was a Dell X300, 1200 Mhz, 640 Mb, running Windows XP SP1.

<a name="graph"></a>
<h2>Time and memory usage</h2>

<p>
A dot-graph of the test runs gives a the most accurate view of the different
behaviors. The horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis memory and time. 

<p>
<b>file storage with file: references</b> (yellow) often is faster than non-reference, but not always. 
<b>Memory storage</b> (blue) is fast, but uses a lot of memory as expected. 
Plain <b>non-reference file storage</b> (red) is most memory-efficient. This is because jar files are copied, unpacked and only resources actually used will be loaded into memory.
</p>
<p>
The full images can be viewed by clicking on the graphs.

<b>Note 1</b>: Memory is <b>heap memory</b>, not disk usage. The intention with the file: reference method is to avoid copying a bundle file to another place in the file system. Disk usage is not measured by these tests.<br>
</p>


<a name="table"></a>
<h2>Mean time and memory usage</h2>

The table below lists the mean values of a test series of 27 runs. Note that
these are <b>approximate values</b>, and variations are to be expected.
