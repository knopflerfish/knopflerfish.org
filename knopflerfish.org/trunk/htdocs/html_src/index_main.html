<h2 class="kf">The OSGi Service Platform</h2>
The <a href="http://www.osgi.org">OSGi Alliance</a>
specifies the <b>OSGi Service Platform</b>,
an industry standard Java application platform, allowing multiple
applications, to securely run in a 
single JVM. These programs can share resources as data, functionality
and threads.
<p>
  Knopflerfish OSGi is an implementaion of the OSGi Specifications.
</p>
<p>
Applications areas for OSGi ranges from use as a service platform on
embedded devices, to plugin mechanisms for larger programs.
The initial goal of OSGi was the embedded market, but other uses
are certainly possible.
