<h3>The OSGi framework</h3>
OSGi, Open Service Gateway Initiative,
specifies an industry standard Java application platform,
allowing multiple applications, to securely run in a
single JVM. These programs can share resources as data, functionality
and threads.

<p>
Applications areas for OSGi ranges from use as a service platform on
embedded devices, to plugin mechanisms for larger programs.
The initial goal of OSGi was the embedded market, but other uses
are certainly possible.
