<h3>Status KF 2, KF 2.0-beta-2 release</h3>

With this second beta release, the KF 2 framework is feature complete
in all mandatory parts. Of the optional parts extension bundles and
permissions are not yet supported. The fragment bundle feature is
included, but is more of an alpha than a beta at this stage. 
<p>
The Service Compendium was already in the beta-1 release feature
complete. Minor fixes has been added in this release. 
</p>
<p>
The desktop and framework commands have been updated in a number of 
ways to reflect new features in K4.
</p>
<p>
The table below describes what parts have been implemented and what parts
are still pending in the KF 2.0 beta 2 release.
