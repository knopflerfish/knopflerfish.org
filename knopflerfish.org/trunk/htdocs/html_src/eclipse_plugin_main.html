<h2>Installation instructions</h2>

<ol>
 <li>Unzip the distribution zip file in your eclipse directory. The following plug-ins are extracted
 to the plugins directory.
 <ul>
 <li>org.knopflerfish.eclipse.core
 <li>org.knopflerfish.eclipse.core.ui
 </ul>
</ol>



<h2>Getting started</h2>



<h3>Specify location of Knopflerfish distribution</h3>
Before developing bundles the location of a Knopflerfish installation must be specified. The information is saved 
in the Eclipse Preferences.

<ol>
 <li>Select Window/Preferences
 <li>In Preferences dialog select OSGi/Knopflerfish
 <li>Select to 'Add' a new Knopflerfish definition and enter 
 location of your Knopflerfish installation in the shown
 dialog page.
</ol>



<h3>Defining bundle sets</h3>
Bundle sets are used to group bundles into logical units, which later can be referred to when selecting bundles to 
deploy on a framework. Bundle set information is saved in the Eclipse Preferences.
<p>
<b>TODO:</b> Work in progress.
</p>


<h3>Creating a new bundle project</h3>

<ol>
 <li>Select File/New/Project...
 <li>Select Bundle Project and enter project info.
 <li>A new project is created. 
</ol>


<h3>Editing Bundle Manifest</h3>
Double click on the bundle.manifest file in your project. The file will be opened in a special editor, which has one tab 
for a graphical view of the manifest and one tab for a text view. Not all attributes can yet be set through the
graphical view, e.g. Import-Package, Export-Package etc. For now you will have to set these attributes in the text
view.

<p>
<b>TODO:</b> Add attributes to the graphical view and help setting them.
</p>

<h3>Using Services</h3>
This is not yet supported in the plugin. For now you will have to manually add the JAR file containing the service API 
to your classpath and also edit the bundle manifest Import-Package attribute, see above.

<p>
<b>TODO:</b> Support usage of services, by given the service package, automatically find bundle JARs exporting this 
package, add it to the build classpath and also update the manifest attribute Import-Package.
</p>


<h3>Running/Debugging</h3>

Create a new launch configuration by selecting 'Run...' or 'Debug...' from the Run menu and thereafter select
Knopflerfish from the confiurations list and press 'New'.

<h4>Launch Configuration</h4>


<h5>Main Tab</h5>
<p>
The main tab is used for setting which framework to run and where to store
the instance data (the .xargs files and the fwdir).
</p>
<p>
In the main tab a list of known system properties are listed and their default values.
When a predefined property is selected a short description is shown. The value can be 
changed either by double-clicking or selecting 'Edit...'. When a predefined property
is changed from its default value it is marked in bold. To restore a property to its
default value, edit the property and in the edit dialog select 'Restore Default'. 
When running/debugging a framework, only properties
that differ from their default values are included in the generated .xargs file.
</p>
<p>
User properties can be added or removed using the 'Add...' or 'Remove' button. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Known Bug:</b> User properties can not be removed.
</p>


<h5>Bundles Tab</h5>
<p>
Under this tab you specify the set of bundles that should be launched together with the
framework.
</p>
<p>
Available Bundles is a tree listing all bundles that are either part of the workspace
or available through an installed Knopflerfish distribution. Bundles already
selected are filtered from the 'Available' tree. Bundles are added to the 
selected list by selecting them and pressing 'Add'.
</p>
<p>
Selected Bundles shows a list of the bundles that are currently selected. 
For each bundle, the start level, mode and missing packages problems are shown.
</p>
<p>
By default the start level is set to 1 for Knopflerfish bundles and to 2 for
workspace bundles. The start level of a bundle can be changed by selecting
the start level cell (click on it).
</p>
<p>
The default value for mode is determined by the bundle's manifest; if a bundle activator exists,
mode is set to 'Start'; otherwise it is set to 'Install'. To change the mode of a bundle, select
the mode cell for that bundle by clicking on it.
</p>
<p>
If a bundle imports packages which are not exported by any of the selected bundles, 
a red error message will be shown in the 'Missing Packages' column indicating the
missing package(s).  
</p>

<h4>Basic configurations</h4>
<p>
This section lists sets of bundles that are needed to run some commonly used applications.
