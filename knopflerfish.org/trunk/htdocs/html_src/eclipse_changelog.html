<table>
 <tr>
  <td nowrap>Core</td>
  <td>
   Bug fix: Jar files where not closed after manifest was read, 
   causing locked files. This would normally happen when, i.e.
   making a clean build after a debug session.

<h3>Changes v1.0.12 2005-12-03</h3>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td nowrap>Editor/Builder</td>
  <td>
   Bug fix. If source had import declarations referencing
   internal classes, the plugin wrongly said that the 
   parent class should be imported in the manifest. E.g.
   If the line import com.foo.Class1.InternalClass 
   existed in the source the plugin would say that the
   package com.foo.Class1 should be imported.
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td nowrap>Export</td>
  <td>
   Bug fix. The plugin did not create the parent directories
   needed for the export path.
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td nowrap>Builder</td>
  <td>
   Bug fix. The resource hierarchy was not refreshed when 
   the bundle jar file was built. This resulted in 
   resource out of synch related errors when for instance
   CVS tried to replace a bundle project from repository.
  </td>

 <tr>
  <td nowrap>Update Site</td>
  <td>
   Bug fix. Attempt to get the update site to work properly.
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td nowrap>Launcher</td>
  <td>
   Bug fix. System properties are checked in order to 
   determine what system packages are exported through
   the system classloader.<br>
   For Knopflerfish the following properties are checked<br>
   - org.osgi.framework.system.packages<br>
   - org.osgi.framework.system.packages.file<br>
   - org.knopflerfish.framework.system.export.all_13<br>
   For eclipse the following properties are checked<br>
   - org.osgi.framework.system.packages<br>
  </td>

 <tr>
  <td nowrap>Editor/Builder</td>
  <td>
   Bug fix. Only packages which contained java resources
   where allowed to be exported.
  </td>

 <tr>
  <td nowrap>Editor/Builder</td>
  <td>
   Bug fix. Large bundle projects could bring eclipse
   to its knees, especially if the manifest editor was
   shown.
