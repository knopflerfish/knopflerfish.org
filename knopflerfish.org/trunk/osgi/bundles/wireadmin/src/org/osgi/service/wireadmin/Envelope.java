/**
 * Identifies a contained value.
 *
 * An <tt>Envelope</tt> object combines a status value, an identification object and
 * a scope name. The <tt>Envelope</tt> object allows the use of standard
 * Java types when a Producer service can produce more than one
 * kind of object. The <tt>Envelope</tt> object allows the Consumer service
 * to recognize the kind of object that is received. For example, a door lock
 * could be represented by a <tt>Boolean</tt> object. If the <tt>Producer</tt> service
 * would send such a <tt>Boolean</tt> object, then the Consumer service would not know
 * what door the <tt>Boolean</tt> object represented. The <tt>Envelope</tt> object contains
 * an identification object so the Consumer service can discriminate between different
 * kinds of values. The identification object may be a simple <tt>String</tt> object, but it can also be
 * a domain specific object that is mutually agreed by the Producer and the
 * Consumer service. This object can then contain relevant information that makes the
 * identification easier.<p>
 * The scope name of the envelope is used for security. The Wire object must verify
 * that any <tt>Envelope</tt> object send through the <tt>update</tt> method or coming from the <tt>poll</tt> method
 * has a scope name that matches the permissions of both the Producer service and the Consumer
 * service involved. The wireadmin package also contains a class <tt>BasicEnvelope</tt> that implements the
 * methods of this interface.
 * @see WirePermission
