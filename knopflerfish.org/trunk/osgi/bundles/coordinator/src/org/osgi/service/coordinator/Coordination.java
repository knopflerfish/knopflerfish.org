/**
 * A Coordination object is used to coordinate a number of independent
 * Participants.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Once a Coordination is {@link Coordinator#create(String, long) created}, it
 * can be used to add {@link Participant} objects. When the Coordination is
 * ended, the participants are {@link Participant#ended(Coordination) notified}.
 * A Coordination can also fail for various reasons. When this occurs, the
 * participants are {@link Participant#failed(Coordination) notified} of the
 * failure.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Coordination must be in one of two states, either ACTIVE or TERMINATED. The
 * transition between ACTIVE and TERMINATED must be atomic, ensuring that a
 * Participant can be guaranteed of either receiving an exception when adding
 * itself to a Coordination or of receiving notification the Coordination has
 * terminated.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Coordination object is thread safe and can be passed as a parameter to
 * other parties regardless of the threads these parties use.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The following example code shows how a Coordination should be used.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * void foo() {
 *   Coordination c = coordinator.create(&quot;work&quot;, 0);
 *   try {
 *     doWork(c);
 *   }
 *   catch (Exception e) {
 *     c.fail(e);
 *   }
 *   finally {
 *     c.end();
 *   }
 * }
