/**
 * A Participant participates in a Coordination.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Participant can participate in a Coordination by
 * {@link Coordination#addParticipant(Participant) registering} itself with the
 * Coordination. After successfully registering itself, the Participant is
 * notified when the Coordination is terminated.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If a Coordination terminates {@link Coordination#end() normally}, then all
 * registered Participants are notified on their {@link #ended(Coordination)}
 * method. If the Coordination terminates as a
 * {@link Coordination#fail(Throwable) failure}, then all registered
 * Participants are notified on their {@link #failed(Coordination)} method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Participants are required to be thread safe as notification can be made on
 * any thread.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Participant can only be registered with a single active Coordination at a
 * time. If a Participant is already registered with an active Coordination,
 * attempts to register the Participation with another active Coordination will
 * block until the Coordination the Participant is registered with terminates.
 * Notice that in edge cases the notification to the Participant that the
 * Coordination has terminated can happen before the registration method
 * returns.
