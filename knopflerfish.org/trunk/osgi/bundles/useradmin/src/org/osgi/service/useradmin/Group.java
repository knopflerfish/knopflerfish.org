/**
 * A named grouping of roles (<tt>Role</tt> objects).
 * <p>
 * Whether or not a given <tt>Authorization</tt> context implies a
 * <tt>Group</tt> object depends on the members of that <tt>Group</tt>
 * object.
 * <p>
 * A <tt>Group</tt> object can have two kinds of members: <i>basic</i> and
 * <i>required</i>. A <tt>Group</tt> object is implied by an
 * <tt>Authorization</tt> context if all of its required members are implied
 * and at least one of its basic members is implied.
 * <p>
 * A <tt>Group</tt> object must contain at least one basic member in order to
 * be implied. In other words, a <tt>Group</tt> object without any basic
 * member roles is never implied by any <tt>Authorization</tt> context.
 * <p>
 * A <tt>User</tt> object always implies itself.
 * <p>
 * No loop detection is performed when adding members to <tt>Group</tt>
 * objects, which means that it is possible to create circular implications.
 * Loop detection is instead done when roles are checked. The semantics is that
 * if a role depends on itself (i.e., there is an implication loop), the role is
 * not implied.
 * <p>
 * The rule that a <tt>Group</tt> object must have at least one basic member
 * to be implied is motivated by the following example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *    group foo
 *      required members: marketing
 *      basic members: alice, bob
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Privileged operations that require membership in "foo" can be performed only
 * by "alice" and "bob", who are in marketing.
 * <p>
 * If "alice" and "bob" ever transfer to a different department, anybody in
 * marketing will be able to assume the "foo" role, which certainly must be
 * prevented. Requiring that "foo" (or any <tt>Group</tt> object for that
 * matter) must have at least one basic member accomplishes that.
 * <p>
 * However, this would make it impossible for a <tt>Group</tt> object to be
 * implied by just its required members. An example where this implication might
 * be useful is the following declaration: "Any citizen who is an adult is
 * allowed to vote." An intuitive configuration of "voter" would be:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *    group voter
 *      required members: citizen, adult
 *         basic members:
 * </pre>
 * 
 * However, according to the above rule, the "voter" role could never be assumed
 * by anybody, since it lacks any basic members. In order to address this issue
 * a predefined role named "user.anyone" can be specified, which is always
 * implied. The desired implication of the "voter" group can then be achieved by
 * specifying "user.anyone" as its basic member, as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *    group voter
 *      required members: citizen, adult
 *         basic members: user.anyone
 * </pre>
