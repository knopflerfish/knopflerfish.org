 * In this context, the term &quot;user&quot; is not limited to just human
 * beings. Instead, it refers to any entity that may have any number of
 * credentials associated with it that it may use to authenticate itself.
 * <p>
 * In general, <tt>User</tt>objects are associated with a specific User Admin
 * service (namely the one that created them), and cannot be used with other
 * User Admin services.
 * <p>
 * A <tt>User</tt>object may have credentials (and properties, inherited from
 * the {@link Role}class) associated with it. Specific
 * {@link UserAdminPermission}objects are required to read or change a
 * <tt>User</tt> object's credentials.
 * <p>
 * Credentials are <tt>Dictionary</tt> objects and have semantics that are
 * similar to the properties in the <tt>Role</tt> class.
