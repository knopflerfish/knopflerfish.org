/**
 * The <tt>Authorization</tt> interface encapsulates an authorization context
 * on which bundles can base authorization decisions, where appropriate.
 * <p>
 * Bundles associate the privilege to access restricted resources or operations
 * with roles. Before granting access to a restricted resource or operation, a
 * bundle will check if the <tt>Authorization</tt> object passed to it possess
 * the required role, by calling its <tt>hasRole</tt> method.
 * <p>
 * Authorization contexts are instantiated by calling the
 * {@link UserAdmin#getAuthorization}method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Trusting Authorization objects</i>
 * <p>
 * There are no restrictions regarding the creation of <tt>Authorization</tt>
 * objects. Hence, a service must only accept <tt>Authorization</tt> objects
 * from bundles that has been authorized to use the service using code based (or
 * Java 2) permissions.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In some cases it is useful to use <tt>ServicePermission</tt> to do the code
 * based access control. A service basing user access control on
 * <tt>Authorization</tt> objects passed to it, will then require that a
 * calling bundle has the <tt>ServicePermission</tt> to get the service in
 * question. This is the most convenient way. The OSGi environment will do the
 * code based permission check when the calling bundle attempts to get the
 * service from the service registry.
 * <p>
 * Example: A servlet using a service on a user's behalf. The bundle with the
 * servlet must be given the <tt>ServicePermission</tt> to get the Http
 * Service.
 * <p>
 * However, in some cases the code based permission checks need to be more
 * fine-grained. A service might allow all bundles to get it, but require
 * certain code based permissions for some of its methods.
 * <p>
 * Example: A servlet using a service on a user's behalf, where some service
 * functionality is open to anyone, and some is restricted by code based
 * permissions. When a restricted method is called (e.g., one handing over an
 * <tt>Authorization</tt> object), the service explicitly checks that the
 * calling bundle has permission to make the call.
