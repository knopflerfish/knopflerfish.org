/**
 * Service for administering configuration data.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The main purpose of this interface is to store bundle configuration data
 * persistently. This information is represented in {@code Configuration}
 * objects. The actual configuration data is a {@code Dictionary} of properties
 * inside a {@code Configuration} object.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are two principally different ways to manage configurations. First
 * there is the concept of a Managed Service, where configuration data is
 * uniquely associated with an object registered with the service registry.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Next, there is the concept of a factory where the Configuration Admin service
 * will maintain 0 or more {@code Configuration} objects for a Managed Service
 * Factory that is registered with the Framework.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The first concept is intended for configuration data about "things/services"
 * whose existence is defined externally, e.g. a specific printer. Factories are
 * intended for "things/services" that can be created any number of times, e.g.
 * a configuration for a DHCP server for different networks.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Bundles that require configuration should register a Managed Service or a
 * Managed Service Factory in the service registry. A registration property
 * named {@code service.pid} (persistent identifier or PID) must be used to
 * identify this Managed Service or Managed Service Factory to the Configuration
 * Admin service.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When the ConfigurationAdmin detects the registration of a Managed Service, it
 * checks its persistent storage for a configuration object whose
 * {@code service.pid} property matches the PID service property (
 * {@code service.pid}) of the Managed Service. If found, it calls
 * {@link ManagedService#updated(Dictionary)} method with the new properties.
 * The implementation of a Configuration Admin service must run these call-backs
 * asynchronously to allow proper synchronization.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When the Configuration Admin service detects a Managed Service Factory
 * registration, it checks its storage for configuration objects whose
 * {@code service.factoryPid} property matches the PID service property of the
 * Managed Service Factory. For each such {@code Configuration} objects, it
 * calls the {@code ManagedServiceFactory.updated} method asynchronously with
 * the new properties. The calls to the {@code updated} method of a
 * {@code ManagedServiceFactory} must be executed sequentially and not overlap
 * in time.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In general, bundles having permission to use the Configuration Admin service
 * can only access and modify their own configuration information. Accessing or
 * modifying the configuration of other bundles requires
 * {@code ConfigurationPermission[location,CONFIGURE]}, where location is the
 * configuration location.
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@code Configuration} objects can be <i>bound</i> to a specified bundle
 * location or to a region (configuration location starts with {@code ?}). If a
 * location is not set, it will be learned the first time a target is
 * registered. If the location is learned this way, the Configuration Admin
 * service must detect if the bundle corresponding to the location is
 * uninstalled. If this occurs, the {@code Configuration} object must be
 * unbound, that is its location field is set back to {@code null}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If target's bundle location matches the configuration location it is always
 * updated.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the configuration location starts with {@code ?}, that is, the location is
 * a region, then the configuration must be delivered to all targets registered
 * with the given PID. If security is on, the target bundle must have
 * Configuration Permission[location,TARGET], where location matches given the
 * configuration location with wildcards as in the Filter substring match. The
 * security must be verified using the
 * {@link org.osgi.framework.Bundle#hasPermission(Object)} method on the target
 * bundle.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If a target cannot be updated because the location does not match or it has
 * no permission and security is active then the Configuration Admin service
 * must not do the normal callback.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The method descriptions of this class refer to a concept of "the calling
 * bundle". This is a loose way of referring to the bundle which obtained the
 * Configuration Admin service from the service registry. Implementations of
 * {@code ConfigurationAdmin} must use a
 * {@link org.osgi.framework.ServiceFactory} to support this concept.
