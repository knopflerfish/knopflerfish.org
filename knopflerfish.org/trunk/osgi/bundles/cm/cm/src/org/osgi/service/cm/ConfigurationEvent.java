 * A Configuration Event.
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@code ConfigurationEvent} objects are delivered to all registered
 * {@code ConfigurationListener} service objects. ConfigurationEvents must be
 * asynchronously delivered in chronological order with respect to each
 * listener.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A type code is used to identify the type of event. The following event types
 * are defined:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #CM_UPDATED}</li>
 * <li>{@link #CM_DELETED}</li>
 * <li>{@link #CM_LOCATION_CHANGED}</li>
 * </ul>
 * Additional event types may be defined in the future.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Security Considerations. {@code ConfigurationEvent} objects do not provide
 * {@code Configuration} objects, so no sensitive configuration information is
 * available from the event. If the listener wants to locate the
 * {@code Configuration} object for the specified pid, it must use
 * {@code ConfigurationAdmin}.
