/**
 * A service that can receive configuration data from a
 * Configuration Admin service.
 *
 * <p>A Managed Service is a service that needs
 * configuration data. Such an object should be registered
 * with the Framework registry with the <tt>service.pid</tt> property set to
 * some unique identitifier called a PID.
 *
 * <p>If the Configuration Admin service has a <tt>Configuration</tt> object corresponding
 * to this PID, it will callback the <tt>updated()</tt> method of the <tt>ManagedService</tt> object,
 * passing the properties of that <tt>Configuration</tt> object.
 *
 * <p>If it has no such <tt>Configuration</tt> object, then it calls
 * back with a <tt>null</tt> properties argument.  Registering a
 * Managed Service will always result in a callback to the <tt>updated()</tt> method
 * provided the Configuration Admin service is, or becomes active.  This
 * callback must always be done asynchronously.
 *
 * <p>Else, every time that either of the <tt>updated()</tt> methods is called
 * on that <tt>Configuration</tt> object, the <tt>ManagedService.updated()</tt> method with the
 * new properties is called. If the <tt>delete()</tt> method is
 * called on that <tt>Configuration</tt> object, <tt>ManagedService.updated()</tt> is called with
 * a <tt>null</tt> for the properties parameter.  All these callbacks must be done asynchronously.
 *
 * <p>The following example shows the code of a serial port that
 * will create a port depending on configuration information.
 * <pre>
 * class SerialPort implements ManagedService {
 *
 *   ServiceRegistration registration;
 *   Hashtable configuration;
 *   CommPortIdentifier id;
 *
 *   synchronized void open(CommPortIdentifier id,
 *   BundleContext context) {
 *     this.id = id;
 *     registration = context.registerService(
 *       ManagedService.class.getName(),
 *       this,
 *       null // Properties will come from CM in updated
 *     );
 *   }
 *
 *   Hashtable getDefaults() {
 *     Hashtable defaults = new Hashtable();
 *     defaults.put( "port", id.getName() );
 *     defaults.put( "product", "unknown" );
 *     defaults.put( "baud", "9600" );
 *     defaults.put( Constants.SERVICE_PID,
 *       "com.acme.serialport." + id.getName() );
 *     return defaults;
 *   }
 *
 *   public synchronized void updated(
 *     Dictionary configuration  ) {
 *     if ( configuration == <tt>null</tt> )
 *       registration.setProperties( getDefaults() );
 *     else {
 *       setSpeed( configuration.get("baud") );
 *       registration.setProperties( configuration );
 *     }
 *   }
 *   ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>As a convention, it is recommended that when a Managed Service
 * is updated, it should copy all the properties it does not
 * recognize into the service registration properties. This will
 * allow the Configuration Admin service to set properties on services which
 * can then be used by other applications.
