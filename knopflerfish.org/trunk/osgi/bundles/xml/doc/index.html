  An overview of XML parsers in Knopflerfish

<h2>XML Parsers</h2>
<p>
  There are several XML parsers included in Knopflerfish, serving different purposes.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="../kxml/index.html">kxml</a> parser is a light-weight,
  low foot-print xml parser that provides all the basic parse functionality,
  but has limitations compared to a more full featured parser. 
x</p>
<p>
 A more full featured parser is Xerces2 from
 <a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/">Apache</a>. Knopflerfish
 includes <a href="../xerces/index.html">xerces</a>, a bundlified version
 of Xerces 2.10.1. Alongside with xerces is also the 
 <a href="../xalan/index.html">xalan</a>, a bundlified version of
 Xalan-Java, version 2.7.1.
</p>
<p>
  There is also the Crimson-XML bundle which is primarily used in
  older version of Java that does not provide built-in XML, as well as
  for backwards compatibility.
