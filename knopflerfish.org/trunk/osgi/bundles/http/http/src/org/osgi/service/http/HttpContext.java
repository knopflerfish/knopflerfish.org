     * If the request requires authentication and the Authorization header in
     * the request is missing or not acceptable, then this method should set the

     * response object to Unauthorized(401) and return <tt>false</tt>. See
     * also RFC 2617: <i>HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access
     * Authentication</i> (available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt).
     * 
     * <p>
     * If the request requires a secure connection and the <tt>getScheme</tt>
     * method in the request does not return 'https' or some other acceptable
     * secure protocol, then this method should set the status in the response
     * object to Forbidden(403) and return <tt>false</tt>.
     * 
     * <p>
     * When this method returns <tt>false</tt>, the Http Service will send
     * the response back to the client, thereby completing the request. When
     * this method returns <tt>true</tt>, the Http Service will proceed with
     * servicing the request.
     * 
     * <p>
     * If the specified request has been authenticated, this method must set the
     * {@link #AUTHENTICATION_TYPE} request attribute to the type of
     * authentication used, and the {@link #REMOTE_USER} request attribute to
     * the remote user (request attributes are set using the
     * <tt>setAttribute</tt> method on the request). If this method does not
     * perform any authentication, it must not set these attributes.
     * 
     * <p>
     * If the authenticated user is also authorized to access certain resources,
     * this method must set the {@link #AUTHORIZATION} request attribute to the
     * <tt>Authorization</tt> object obtained from the
     * <tt>org.osgi.service.useradmin.UserAdmin</tt> service.
     * 
     * <p>
     * The servlet responsible for servicing the specified request determines
