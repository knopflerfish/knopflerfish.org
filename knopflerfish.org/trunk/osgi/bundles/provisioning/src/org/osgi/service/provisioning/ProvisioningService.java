/**
 * Service for managing the initial provisioning information.
 * <p>
 * Initial provisioning of an OSGi device is a multi step process that
 * culminates with the installation and execution of the initial management
 * agent. At each step of the process, information is collected for the next
 * step. Multiple bundles may be involved and this service provides a means for
 * these bundles to exchange information. It also provides a means for the
 * initial Management Bundle to get its initial configuration information.
 * <p>
 * The provisioning information is collected in a <code>Dictionary</code>
 * object, called the Provisioning Dictionary. Any bundle that can access the
 * service can get a reference to this object and read and update provisioning
 * information. The key of the dictionary is a <code>String</code> object and
 * the value is a <code>String</code> or <code>byte[]</code> object. The
 * single exception is the PROVISIONING_UPDATE_COUNT value which is an Integer.
 * The <code>provisioning</code> prefix is reserved for keys defined by OSGi,
 * other key names may be used for implementation dependent provisioning
 * systems.
 * <p>
 * Any changes to the provisioning information will be reflected immediately in
 * all the dictionary objects obtained from the Provisioning Service.
 * <p>
 * Because of the specific application of the Provisioning Service, there should
 * be only one Provisioning Service registered. This restriction will not be
 * enforced by the Framework. Gateway operators or manufactures should ensure
 * that a Provisioning Service bundle is not installed on a device that already
 * has a bundle providing the Provisioning Service.
 * <p>
 * The provisioning information has the potential to contain sensitive
 * information. Also, the ability to modify provisioning information can have
 * drastic consequences. Thus, only trusted bundles should be allowed to
 * register and get the Provisioning Service. The <code>ServicePermission</code>
 * is used to limit the bundles that can gain access to the Provisioning
 * Service. There is no check of <code>Permission</code> objects to read or
 * modify the provisioning information, so care must be taken not to leak the
 * Provisioning Dictionary received from <code>getInformation</code> method.
