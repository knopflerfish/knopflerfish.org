<h2>Native Executable</h2>

<p>
The bundle activator utility class ExecutableBundleActivator can be used
if you need to package an executable binary in your bundle that should be
extracted and started when the bundle starts.
</p>

<p>
  Depending on your needs you can either write your own bundle activator
  that extends ExecutableBundleActivator or use it directly without writing
  any Java code at all. If you use it directly, all you need to do is to
  add custom headers to your manifest that controls the behavior of
  ExecutableBundleActivator.
</p>

<p>
  The following are the required headers for a simple example.
<pre>
 Manifest-Version: 1.0
 Bundle-SymbolicName: org.knopflerfish.bundle.ebaexample
 Bundle-Activator: org.knopflerfish.util.framework.ExecutableBundleActivator
 Import-Package = org.knopflerfish.util.framework,org.osgi.framework
 Bundle-Start-Executable: notepad.exe ; processor=x86 ; osname=WindowsXP
</pre>
</p>

<p>
In this case there is only one custom header, Bundle-Start-Executable. It
declares that if the native environment matches OS = Windows XP and
processor architecture = x86, the resource named notepad.exe should be
extracted from the bundle, written to the local file system and launched
using java.lang.Runtime.exec() when the bundle is started.
</p>

<p>
The exec:ed process will be terminated when the bundle stops. If the
process is terminated, the bundle will be stopped (this is the default 
behavior).
</p>

<p>
Complete list of custom headers for this utility class:
<dl>
  <dt><b>Bundle-Start-Executable</b></dt>
  <dd>List of native environments (OS, processor, etc) and native
      executables for those environments. If there is a match for the
      current native environment, the executable is copied to the local
      file system and started in the start method of
      ExecutableBundleActivator.
      The syntax for this header is the same as for the OSGi specified
      <tt>Bundle-NativeCode</tt> header but instead of naming a shared
      library you name a native executable. The <tt>Bundle-NativeCode</tt>
      header is described in the core OSGi specification chapter 3.9.</dd>
  <dt><b>Bundle-Start-Executable-Args</b></dt>
  <dd>Arguments (separated with spaces) for the bundle start executable.
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Bundle-Stop-Executable</b></dt>
  <dd>Similar to <tt>Bundle-Start-Executable</tt> but the executable
      is lunched when the bundle stops.</dd>
  <dt><b>Bundle-Stop-Executable-Args</b></dt>
  <dd>Arguments (separated with spaces) for the bundle stop executable.
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Bundle-Extract-Files</b></dt>
  <dd>List of extra resources (separated with comma) that should be
  copied from the bundle jar file to the local file system.</dd>
  <dt><b>Bundle-Start-Executable-Exit-Means-Bundle-Stop</b></dt>
  <dd>Set this to false if you do not want the bundle to be stopped when
      the process that was launched in start() is terminated.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In many cases you want to write your own activator that extends
ExecutableBundleActivator. You can then for example override logging
which is on and to stdout by default. Also, you need to write your own
activator if you want your bundle to do more than starting a native
executable.
</p>

<p>
Files that are extracted (executables and other resources) are written to
the bundle's persistent storage area. Cleanup of the files takes place
when the bundle is uninstalled.
