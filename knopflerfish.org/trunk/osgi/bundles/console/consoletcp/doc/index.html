<h2>Description</h2>

<p>

The Console TCP bundle is a tcp server that makes Knopflerfish console
commands available to the end user. Any tcp client can be used to
connect to it.

This bundle is typically used during development.


<h3>Configuration using the Configuration Manager</h3>

The tcp console bundle accepts a configuration with the PID

</pre>

and with the following properties:

<dl>

<dt>host</dt>
<dd>Host name (IP address) of the interface to listen for tcp
    connections to the console on.</dd>

<dt>port</dt>
<dd>Port to listen for tcp connections to the console on.</dd>

<dt>um</dt>
<dd>If set to true User Management is required. I.e., if there is no
    UserAdmin service in the system login will be denied. When set to

<dt>useTimeout</dt>
<dd>Enable/disable setting of SO_TIMEOUT for the client socket.</dd>

<dt>exitOnLogout</dt>
<dd>Indicates if the session should be closed if the user logs out. If
