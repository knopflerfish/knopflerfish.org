/**
 * A synchronous {@code BundleEvent} listener. {@code SynchronousBundleListener}
 * is a listener interface that may be implemented by a bundle developer. When a
 * {@code BundleEvent} is fired, it is synchronously delivered to a
 * {@code SynchronousBundleListener}. The Framework may deliver
 * {@code BundleEvent} objects to a {@code SynchronousBundleListener} out of
 * order and may concurrently call and/or reenter a
 * {@code SynchronousBundleListener}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For {@code BundleEvent} types {@link BundleEvent#STARTED STARTED} and
 * {@link BundleEvent#LAZY_ACTIVATION LAZY_ACTIVATION}, the Framework must not
 * hold the referenced bundle's &quot;state change&quot; lock when the
 * {@code BundleEvent} is delivered to a {@code SynchronousBundleListener}. For
 * the other {@code BundleEvent} types, the Framework must hold the referenced
 * bundle's &quot;state change&quot; lock when the {@code BundleEvent} is
 * delivered to a {@code SynchronousBundleListener}. A
 * {@code SynchronousBundleListener} cannot directly call life cycle methods on
 * the referenced bundle when the Framework is holding the referenced bundle's
 * &quot;state change&quot; lock.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A {@code SynchronousBundleListener} object is registered with the Framework
 * using the {@link BundleContext#addBundleListener(BundleListener)} method.
 * {@code SynchronousBundleListener} objects are called with a
 * {@code BundleEvent} object when a bundle has been installed, resolved,
 * starting, started, stopping, stopped, updated, unresolved, or uninstalled.
 * <p>
 * Unlike normal {@code BundleListener} objects,
 * {@code SynchronousBundleListener}s are synchronously called during bundle
 * lifecycle processing. The bundle lifecycle processing will not proceed until
 * all {@code SynchronousBundleListener}s have completed.
 * {@code SynchronousBundleListener} objects will be called prior to
 * {@code BundleListener} objects.
 * <p>
 * {@code AdminPermission[bundle,LISTENER]} is required to add or remove a
 * {@code SynchronousBundleListener} object.
 *
