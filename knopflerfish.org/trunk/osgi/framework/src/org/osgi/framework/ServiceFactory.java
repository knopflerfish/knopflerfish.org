/**
 * Allows services to provide customized service objects in the OSGi environment.
 *
 * <p>When registering a service, a <tt>ServiceFactory</tt> object can
 * be used instead of a service object, so that the bundle developer can gain control
 * of the specific service object granted to a bundle that is using the service.
 *
 * <p>When this happens, the <tt>BundleContext.getService(ServiceReference)</tt> method calls the
 * <tt>ServiceFactory.getService</tt> method to create a service object specifically for the
 * requesting bundle. The service object returned by the <tt>ServiceFactory</tt> object
 * is cached by the Framework until the bundle releases its use of the service.
 *
 * <p>When the bundle's use count for the service equals zero (including the bundle stopping
 * or the service being unregistered), the <tt>ServiceFactory.ungetService</tt> method is called.
 *
 * <p><tt>ServiceFactory</tt> objects are only used by the Framework and are not
 * made available to other bundles in the OSGi environment.
