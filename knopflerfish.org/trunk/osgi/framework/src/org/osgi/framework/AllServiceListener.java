/**
 * A {@code ServiceEvent} listener that does not filter based upon package
 * wiring. {@code AllServiceListener} is a listener interface that may be
 * implemented by a bundle developer. When a {@code ServiceEvent} is fired, it
 * is synchronously delivered to an {@code AllServiceListener}. The Framework
 * may deliver {@code ServiceEvent} objects to an {@code AllServiceListener} out
 * of order and may concurrently call and/or reenter an
 * {@code AllServiceListener}.
 * <p>
 * An {@code AllServiceListener} object is registered with the Framework using
 * the {@code BundleContext.addServiceListener} method.
 * {@code AllServiceListener} objects are called with a {@code ServiceEvent}
 * object when a service is registered, modified, or is in the process of
 * unregistering.
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@code ServiceEvent} object delivery to {@code AllServiceListener} objects is
 * filtered by the filter specified when the listener was registered. If the
 * Java Runtime Environment supports permissions, then additional filtering is
 * done. {@code ServiceEvent} objects are only delivered to the listener if the
 * bundle which defines the listener object's class has the appropriate
 * {@code ServicePermission} to get the service using at least one of the named
 * classes under which the service was registered.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Unlike normal {@code ServiceListener} objects, {@code AllServiceListener}
 * objects receive all {@code ServiceEvent} objects regardless of whether the
 * package source of the listening bundle is equal to the package source of the
 * bundle that registered the service. This means that the listener may not be
 * able to cast the service object to any of its corresponding service
 * interfaces if the service object is retrieved.
