<h1>Axis2 OSGi</h1>

<div class="abstract">
This is an OSGi bundlification of a standard Axis2 server.
</div>

<p> The bundle is part of the <a href="../soap/index.html#axis1">The
Knopflerfish Axis 2</a> package.  </p>


<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
In order to export a service object as a
SOAP service, the only thing needed is to set a property named
"SOAP.service.name" on the registered service. As a convenience
<tt>org.knopflerfish.service.axis2.Axis2Admin.SOAP_SERVICE_NAME</tt> is
a String constant that holds this name. The property value should be
of type java.lang.String and its value will be used as the name of the
exposed SOAP service.</p>

<p> The set of service methods exported from a service with the
<tt>SOAP.service.name</tt> property set can be controlled via another
service property named, <tt>SOAP.service.methods</tt>. 

<ul>
 <li>If not set, or set to the value <tt>*</tt> then <b>all</b> methods in the registered classes are exposed as web service methods. </li>
 <li>If set to a string with space separated method names, only 
     those methods will be exposed as web service methods.</li>
 <li>If set to a valid LDAP filter string, only methods names matching
     the filter will be added. For example, <tt>(name=get*)</tt> will
     export all <tt>get*()</tt> methods.
 </li>
</ul>

As a convenience
<tt>org.knopflerfish.service.axis2.Axis2Admin.SOAP_SERVICE_METHODS</tt>
is a String constant that holds this service property name.  </p>

<p> The initial SOAP configuration of the Axis server is given by the
file "/axis/server-config.wsdd". In case you want to add some services
or for some other reason modify the initial configuration, this is
where to do it.</p>

<p> The code to make all this work consist of just a few quite small
classes (not counting all Axis classes) so it is quite easy to get an
overview of the porting effort. However it took some time
experimenting and studying the Axis code to make this work, so some of
the code may be harder to understand.</p>

<p> Note that the axis-osgi bundle depends on the commons-logging
bundle to be installed an started. Further if your JRE does not
support an XML parser you need to provide that as well (e.g Xerces).
</p>

<p> 
The axis-osgi.jar file is quite large due to the contained
axis2 jar files, even though some axis2 libraries are removed. For details and axis2 licenses, see contents of axis2-osgi/resources/WEB-INF/lib
