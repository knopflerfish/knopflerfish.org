Release Notes Knopflerfish @VERSION@
--------------------------------

  Maintenance release of Knopflerfish

  Here follows a breakdown of the most important changes since the 
  last release.

=== Framework (Core) ===

  The default value of the system property named
    org.knopflerfish.servicereference.valid.during.unregistering
  is changed from false to true. See osgi/framework/readme.txt for details.
  This change is done in accordance to a clarification done by CPEG
  February 2008.

  ASM 3.1 is now used for byte code patching.

  New system property named
    org.knopflerfish.framework.debug.print_with_do_privileged
  If set to false debug printouts are not wrapped in doPrivileged().
  See osgi/framework/readme.txt for details.

=== Services (Compendium) ===
      
  Http Server / JSDK

  The JSDK bundle exports Servlet API version 2.5 (was 2.2). 
  Note: the JSDK-bundles have been redesigned from being a LIB-bundle
  to an API-bundle. I.e., it does not wrap a servlet.jar-file any
  more, all classes are directly available inside the API-jar. This
  increases performance and simplifies for other bundles that needs
  access to the classes during their build phase.

  The http-server is updated to work with the version 2.5 of the Servlet API.

  Build files for servlet aware bundles updated to build using classes
  from jsdk_api-2.5.jar.


  Component Service

  Fixed a class-cast bug when loading array valued (non-String)
  properties from the XML document. See forum thread 
  https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1937504&amp;forum_id=328005
  for details.

  Fix issue [1895316]. Service References published by Component Service
  on behalf of some component where missing the component.id property.


=== Misc (KF specific, start scritps, build system etc ===

  Desktop

  The initial directory for the add bundle dialog in the Desktop is 
  now based on the system property "org.knopflerfish.gosg.jars" if
  set to a file URL, otherwise the current working directory is used.


  Axis-OSGi

  Bean-mappings for all classes used in exported, non-array valued
  parameters (and the return value) are now added to the WSDD
  generated by ObjectSOAPService for objects to export as
  WebServices. This will allow use of non-standard types when
  exporting a service as an Axis WebService.


  Build System

  More adjustments to the build system to improve nightly- and
  release- builds.
