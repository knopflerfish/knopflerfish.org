  Here follows a breakdown of the most important changes since the
  last release.


=== Framework (Core) ===

  Framework 5.0.2

  - Fixed handling of org.osgi.framework.storage property on command line.

  - Merged fix of classloader problem when running on Android 7/8 from
    the kf_2_support branch. The boot-classloader of Android does not
    return the expected null as its parent classloader, it returns
    itself.

  Bundlerepository 3.1.2

  - Use "http://www.knopflerfish.org/releases/current-kf_3/repository.xml"
    as the default repository URL for non-release builds. Release
    builds will use the repository of that release.


  Xalan 2.7.1.kf3_01

  - Set export and import versions of javax.xml.* packages so that
    it works together with the xerces bundle.
