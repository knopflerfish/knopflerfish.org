Release Notes Knopflerfish @VERSION@ (OSGi R4 v4.2)
--------------------------------------------------

  Maintenance release of Knopflerfish available from
  @DOWNLOAD_URL@

  Here follows a breakdown of the most important changes since the
  last release.


=== Framework (Core) ===

  Framework 5.1.7

  - Fixed consistency issues when doing update/uninstall.


=== Services (Compendium) ===

  HTTP-Server 3.0.3

  - Changed request uri parsing logic in order to avoid problems with
    some URL class implementations.


=== Misc (KF specific, start scripts, build system etc) ===

  Build System

  - Started to use macrodefs in bundlebuild.xml to reduce its size and
    increase readability. No functional change.
  - The bundlesinfo-task can now derive both Import-Package and
    Export-Package in one call. Nested elements that are file-sets
    named 'exports' and 'impls' determines which packages included in
    the bundle that shall be exported and which packages to keep
    private.
  - Added an antlib.xml file defining all the provided tasks to the
    bundle_tasks.jar.
  - The bundle_tasks.jar is now only built if not present. I.e.,
    when changing any of the taskt an explicit build must be done in
    the ant-subdir to create an up-to date version of the
    bundle_tasks.jar-file.
  - Fixed so that KF builds with ant 1.8.


Release Notes Knopflerfish 3.1.0 (OSGi R4 v4.2)
--------------------------------------------------

  Maintenance release of Knopflerfish available from
  http://www.knopflerfish.org/releases/3.1.0

  Here follows a breakdown of the most important changes since the
  last release.


=== Framework (Core) ===

  Framework 5.1.6

  - Always wait for stop operations to complete before continuing.
  - Fixed bug with call to removed a removed service listener.
  - Fixed race conditions in StartLevel-service and Bundle.getHeaders().
  - Fixed bug when shutting down a framework running at start level 1.
  - Fixed IllegalArgumentException for StartLevel-service.
  - Add threaded handling of listeners, this means that asynchronous listeners
    will be called asynchronously. The number of threads used is controlled via
    the property, org.knopflerfish.framework.listener.n_threads. Default value
    is 1. If the value is 0 then we will revert to the old behavior and call
    all listeners synchronously. Also fixed some minor bugs that was revealed
    during the testing of the new listener handling.
  - Use system properties to set default values for OSGi framework properties.
  - Recognize deprecated processor value "arm" in native code matching.
  - Fixed locking problem when stopping a crashed bundle.
  - Fixed NPE when unregistering URLStreamHandlerService.
  - Fixed getEntry() method for system bundle. The result will
    vary depending on the JVM since we use getResource() via the
    framework class loader.
  - Fixed handling of none null boot-classloader.
  - Fixed bug in lazy activation class filtering.
  - Fixed handling of org.osgi.framework.storage property on command line.
  - Merged fix of class loader problem when running on Android 7/8 from
    the kf_2_support branch. The boot-classloader of Android does not
    return the expected null as its parent class loader, it returns
    itself.


=== Services (Compendium) ===

  Event 3.0.4
  
  - Fixed infinite loop when debug logging was enabled for event admin.


  Deploymentadmin 1.0.1

  - The version of the "org.osgi.service.deploymentadmin.spi"-package
    that this bundle exports was wrong, for OSGi R4 v4.2 the version

    version stated in the Export-Package header that was wrong.


  Dmtree 1.0.1

  - The version of the "org.osgi.service.dmtree"-package
    that this bundle exports was wrong, for OSGi R4 v4.2 the version
    should be 1.0.1 and nothing else. Note that it was only the
    version stated in the Export-Package header that was wrong.
  - This bundle must use dynamic import package "*" to allow a bundle
    to provide the digest class specified by the system property
    "org.osgi.vendor.dmtree.DigestDelegate".


  HTTP-Server 3.0.1

  - The version of the "org.osgi.service.http"-package that this
    bundle exports was wrong, for OSGi R4 v4.2 the version should be

    in the Export-Package header that was wrong.


  Log 3.0.5

  - Fix NPE in 3.0.4. Register ManagedService with a PID that matches
    configuration meta data. LogRef now handles calls to the
    log()-methods occurring after the bundle it logs for have been
    stopped.
  - Clean up old broken Java-Doc comments and remove a potential
    problem with synchronization on non-final variables.
  - Use a cache to avoid recomputing the log-level for a bundle for
    each entry it sends to the logs.
  - Resolved some dead-locks and NullPointerExceptions occurring during
    shut-down that was made visible by the listener handling changes
    in the v 5.1 of the framework.


  Measurement 3.0.1

  - The version of the "org.osgi.util.measurement"-package that this
    bundle exports was wrong, for OSGi R4 v4.2 the version should be
    1.0.1 and nothing else. Note that it was only the version stated
    in the Export-Package header that was wrong.


  Position 3.0.1

    bundle exports was wrong, for OSGi R4 v4.2 the version should be
    1.0.1 and nothing else. Note that it was only the version stated
    in the Export-Package header that was wrong.


  Kf_metatype 3.0.1

  - Made bundle listeners synchronous, so that we always have
    the correct state of the metatype information.


=== Misc (KF specific, start scripts, build system etc) ===

  Bundlerepository 3.1.2

  - Use "http://www.knopflerfish.org/releases/current-kf_3/repository.xml"
    as the default repository URL for non-release builds. Release
    builds will use the repository of that release.


  Desktop 3.1.5

  - Ensure that all code handles a null PackageAdmin-service object.
  - When the path from the property "org.knopflerfish.gosg.jars"
    contains more than one element, use the first one that exists as
    the starting directory of the install bundle dialog.
  - Removed some NullPointerExceptions during shut-down that was made
    visible by the listener handling changes in  v 5.1 of the framework.
  - The version of the "org.osgi.service.cm"-package
    that this bundle re-exports was wrong, for OSGi R4 v4.2 the version
    should be 1.3.0 and nothing else. Note that it was only the
    version stated in the Export-Package header that was wrong.
  - The version of the "org.osgi.service.event"-package
    that this bundle re-exports was wrong, for OSGi R4 v4.2 the version
    should be 1.2.0 and nothing else. Note that it was only the
    version stated in the Export-Package header that was wrong.
  - The version of the "org.osgi.service.prefs"-package
    that this bundle re-exports was wrong, for OSGi R4 v4.2 the version
    should be 1.1.1 and nothing else. Note that it was only the
    version stated in the Export-Package header that was wrong.
  - Fixed a dead-lock problem caused by a bundle listener that did
    call-backs to the framework on the event delivery thread which a
    framework implementation does not need to support.
  - The large icons displayer now scrolls to make new bundles visible
    again.
  - The set of selected bundles no longer changes when a bundle is
    started, stopped, updated, refreshed. The problem was caused by
    the bundle details displayer that fired to coarse table model
    change events when receiving bundle change events from the
    framework, causing the underlying swing table model to clear all
    selections.
  

  FW-Tray 3.0.2

  - A class loader may throw a NoClassDefFoundError when it fails to
    define a class since some class that the class to be loaded needs
    are missing. Changed the tray icon bundle to handle this, i.e., it
    now catches Throwable and not just Exception when trying to
    instantiate java.awt.SystemTray.


  Xalan 2.7.1.kf3_01

  - Set export and import versions of javax.xml.* packages so that
    it works together with the Xerxes bundle. 


  Build System

  - The "Bundle" task now uses the version from the "packageinfo"-file
    when generating the export packages header.
  - bundlebuidl.xml did not create an Export-Package header for
    impl-bundles that specified an "impl-api.pattern".
  - The BundleInfoTask now assigns versions to exported packages based
    on the version specified in the "packageinfo"-file in the
    directory that holds the classes of the package. The build will
    fail if there is a miss-match between the version given in the
    template manifest and the version in the "packageinfo"-file.
  - bundlebuild.xml now copies resources from the source tree to the
    classes tree in the compile step. The internal target that added
    resources from the source tree to the bundle jar file has been
    removed since those resources are added to the jar
