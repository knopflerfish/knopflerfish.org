Release Notes Knopflerfish 2.0.1
--------------------------------

  This is the first bugfix release after Knopflerfish 2.0.

  Here follows a breakdown of the most important changes.


=== Framework (R4.core) ===

  * Boot Delegation
             This release includes support for the property
               org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation
             By setting this property you control what class should be loaded
             from the system class loader. Setting
             org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation to say "org.knopflerfish.*" will
             cause the framework to try to load all class names matching that
             pattern using the system class loader. If this fails the framework
             will try to load the class as any other class. 

             In earlier versions the system behaved as if this property was set
             to "*", that is the framework all ways checked if the system class
             loader could load a given class. This property is set to * by
             default to be backward compliant. 

             More information on this can be found in the R4 core specs section
             3.8.3.

  * Import Resolution Optional
             An issue with imported packages marked as optional has been fixed.

  * Limitations
             As was the case in 2.0, all OSGi R4 features except those listed
             below are implemented:

             * Signed bundles are not supported yet.
             * Conditional Permission Admin is not included.
    
             To use the extension bundle support you need to use a wrapper
             script that will restart framework when needed. An example
             shell-script is included (osgi/kf2).


=== Services (R4.cmpn) ===

  * User Admin service
             Added persistence. The path to the file where user admin data is
             stored can be set with the system property
               org.knopflerfish.useradmin.store
             If this is not set, the bundle's data storage area is used,
             meaning that starting the platform with -init purges the data.
             One can also use the system property
               org.knopflerfish.useradmin.oldstore
             to define a path that is used to read the data if the
             org.knopflerfish.useradmin.store property is set to a path that
             does not exist yet. This can be used to move the store to a new
             location. The persistence can be turned off by setting the
             system property
               org.knopflerfish.useradmin.dontsave
             to true.

  * Declarative services
             Fixed a bug where, under certain circumstances, null was passed
             to bind/unbind methods.
