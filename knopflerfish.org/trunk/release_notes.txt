Release Notes Knopflerfish 2.0.3
--------------------------------

  Maintenance release of Knopflerfish

  Here follows a breakdown of the most important changes.

=== Framework (Core) ===

  * Bug fix, Registered services are removed from the registry
    directly when SeriveRegistration.unregister() is called.
    
    Bundles with access to the ServiceReference for a service may get
    the service during the unregistering phase if the system property 
    org.knopflerfish.servicereference.valid.during.unregistering
    have been set to "true" otherwise null will be returned.

  * Bug fix, Calling bundle.getResources(String) on the bundle object
    for the System bundle throws a ClassCastExcpetion.
    
  * Bundle.getResource("/") now returns a valid URL to the root of the
    bundle's classpath. Bundle.getResources("/") now returns an
    enumeration of root URLs for the bundles class path. Both these
    methods previously returned null when called with the argument "/".

  * Bug fix, Bundle.getResources(name) did not include resources from
    attached fragments if one or more matches was found in the bundle
    itself.

  * EventAdmin
    Updates Event class to allow for alphanumeric event topics

  * URLConnection
    Added getContentType and getContentLength
